The apartment was very comfortable and I really enjoyed having the park with running path across the street. The only downside was it wasn't within walking distance to restaurants, bars, or coffee shops. But they are a short drive away. Overall, great stay!"

2708,14606598,2014-06-23,2247288,Camilla,"Charles is just amazing and he made my stay special. He is so nice, helpful and absolutely polite. Charles is always there when you need some advice or help and totally respects your privacy too. I could concentrate on my work while Charles was doing his work - also absolutely quiet. The apartment is perfectly tidy, very clean, with tasty furniture and beautiful details. My bedroom even had a desk in it. Also, the apartment is located in a perfect area, most sightseeing spots are in walking distance and there are some very nice restaurants around as well. I highly recommend this place!"
2708,39597339,2015-07-25,27974696,Fallon,Staying with Chas was an absolute pleasure. He was very accommodating and respectful of personal space. He is truly a nice person. He was very helpful and I am grateful that he opened up his home to me. I am glad to have met him.

2708,66196280,2016-03-20,23408691,Massimo Litterio,Chas is a really good host. He gives me a lot of good advice during my stay. Always trying to make my stay as much comfortable as possible.
2708,222420570,2017-12-29,155985882,Manami,ホストはとても親切で英語の発音の仕方など丁寧に教えてくれた。<br/>部屋はリビングを板で仕切っているのであまりプライバシーが守られていない。<br/>朝になると電話の音やキッチンの音や話し声がそのまま聞こえる。<br/>ハリウッドの中心地から歩いて15分程なのでロケーションは最高はとても便利。<br/>スーパーやその他ショップ、バス停も徒歩5分以内。
2708,225209928,2018-01-05,6840784,Diego,"Chas house feels like home, it is clean, it has bright energy, it’s mystical, it’s fabulous. Charles is a very hospitable man, kind and soft hearted, he made me feel well looked after and confortable. Thank you for your time, I learned about myself."

2708,284617908,2018-07-01,93292025,Harjinder,Wow; Charles was a delight to meet a very warm and friendly man whom made me feel comfortable and at ease throughout my stay. Truly someone I will remember for his warmth and generosity. The apartment was homley and the location was perfect for anyone whom is looking for central proximity. I strongly recomend this place as your 1st choice.
2708,291375787,2018-07-15,183639942,Taylor,Chas. has a great space ! Loved how clean everything was and how available he was to help out with anything I needed!
2708,296879491,2018-07-26,37846734,John,"Chas is a great host, very friendly and welcoming (and informative!).  He keeps his place spotless and quiet, so this is a great location for people looking to relax or reset from a day out in Los Angeles.  The location is amazing and walkable to many stores and restaurants.  I especially enjoyed the in-building sauna and spa as a way to unwind at the end of the day.   In addition, the underground, secured parking is a great find (especially in the summer heat).  I'll definitely stay here next time I'm in the area."
2708,306500549,2018-08-12,48408491,Andrew,"Charles place is lovely and in a great location. Very central and close to things nearby. The small private gym and sauna are a great little touch I used a lot. The bed was big and really comfortable and Charles is an accommodating, friendly and informative host. Great find"
2708,319965969,2018-09-07,51146446,Stephanie,Charles's place is great! It is very clean and centrally located. He also goes out of his way to make sure that you enjoy your stay.
2708,358265929,2018-12-13,118296038,Aziz Ibrahim,"Charles place will not disappoint for a second, it has all necessities needed to have a comfortable stay. As a person that is sensitive to dust,  I really appreciated that the apartment is clean and has good ventilation. The location of the apartment is incredible you really are a split second from alot of happenings. I really enjoyed my stay and I hope to be back very soon. On top of the great apartment, Charles as a host is truly an unicorn. Very good at communication, understanding the needs of the guest and making sure the stay is comfortable. Truly an unique experience!"
2708,417933068,2019-02-28,153706631,Andrea,"Chas is an amazing host and I absolutely recommend his place. It's very clean, you have enough privacy and the location is great too, as there is everything like restaurants, grocery and metro station in walking distance. I had an awesome time there and really enjoyed my stay!"
2708,425630420,2019-03-18,13903098,Tami,"Chas. is an excellent host, and this is a great location and a great space. Chas. was very accommodating even when my flight was delayed, and he was always willing to go the extra mile to make sure that I was happy with everything about my stay. This is a great location even if you do not have a car, since public transportation is plentiful in this area and there are also a lot of restaurants and shops in easy walking distance, but Chas. also made it easy for me to park my car in his building. All in all, this was a great stay, and I highly recommend it."
2708,443320279,2019-04-25,228846650,Stefanie,"I had an amazing time at Charles place. He made me feel very welcome and comfortable. The location is amazing and you can find many shops and restaurants in walking distance. Charles is an incredibly kind, informative and helpful host. <br/>I will definitely stay here again the next time I am in LA!"
2708,448958815,2019-05-05,2126071,Kj,"Chas was very hospitable! I would stay here again. The Location was perfect, walking distance to everything I needed, and the bed was very comfortable. Everyone kept to themselves so it felt private and he was there if I needed anything. I recommend!!"
2708,452259654,2019-05-12,141434769,Matthew,"As you might have gleaned from the other reviews, Chas was amazing. A gracious and warm welcome was followed by a sparkling clean appartment. There was a mutual respect between everyone and there was a relaxing sense of silence and peace in the space."
2708,456137752,2019-05-20,249489563,Morgan,"I had a great time at Charles place, he is a great host in every possible way. The room (and the common areas)<br/>is cozy, nice and clean. The bed is very comfortable, there is a desk and plenty of space for storage should you need it.<br/>This place has everything you're likely to need on your travels, highly recommended!"

2708,521262231,2019-08-31,32253750,Adrian,"Chas place is a gem, conveniently located to shops , grocery stores, night life entertainment and more. Easy to get around as everything is close by.   <br/>In addition his place is as described and even better; very serene, neat, and most especially comfortable. <br/>Chas is a warm and welcoming host , and ensures the place is always kept clean as much as possible.  Highly recommend to anyone visiting Los Angeles."
2708,576181646,2019-12-12,79475501,Jenny,"Wonderful hospitality, strongly recommend!"
2708,619302203,2020-03-17,117823684,Nathan,"Location is decent (near some great music stores, restaurants, and a lot of other things to do). The room itself is decent. I didn't know that the room wouldn't offer any blockage from sounds in the living room, because it didn't have a closed wall. The bed stank of body odor before I got there, so I had to Febreeze the bed multiple times over to make it usable, but there was a Febreeze bottle available. <br/>There were a few days that I had to be sure to be out of the room, because the owner was having work done on the door that was attached to my room. It was an unforeseen inconvenience, but he made up for it by giving me $10 for lunch.<br/>One one of those days that I was waiting for the workers in the room, I happened to be outside the main door and the building owner came by and told me that there were to be absolutely no AirBnB guests in the building. That, of course, freaked me out. I told the owner of the room of what just happened and he told me that rule only applied to short term stays, not long term guests. So that was resolved.<br/>In case of a pandemic (like the COVID-19) be aware that your money won't be returned, even after a personal discussion with the owner about the current issues and the necessity to return home early. Not even a week after I returned home, LA put just about everything on lockdown and there was a high chance that I wouldn't have been able to return home at all if I stayed for the original plan. The owner and I spoke about it and he agreed to give me a refund and I offered to give him some money in return for all the trouble that it caused. A week later, I received a message from AirBnB, saying that he decided not to return anything at all  to me in the midst of the pandemic and in spite of our discussion and my perceived mutual understanding. <br/>Because of his policy, he is within his rights to keep the money. I had only hoped that our verbal agreement would've been honored."
2708,632352136,2020-06-26,275399037,Tom,Charles was not only a gracious and accommodating host but he’s also full of insight and really cares about his guests.<br/>He is an outstanding resource so use him!<br/>The best way to get the most out of your experience with him is to talk to him and really understand he has the best intention for you!<br/>I would recommend Charles to anyone new to the LA area and really do consider him a friend!
2708,644815726,2020-07-31,54526949,Jonathan,"This here is by far the best Airbnb I’ve stayed at, the apartment and building are beautiful and the amenities are amazing.<br/>Chas is by far the best Airbnb host I’ve ever had. Super helpful, thoughtful and very kind. He will help you with any questions you have about LA and will give you great advice. 100% the best spot in Hollywood."
2708,671921980,2020-10-06,354881527,Haji,Top notch spot to stay within walking distance to most everything in West Hollywood.

2708,733454164,2021-02-21,349357923,Gwendolyn,Very nice place to stay...Charles was great 👍🏻
2708,388464514550605494,2021-06-19,130482838,Adam,"I had a good experience and Charles works very hard to keep the place immaculately clean. This was one of the cleanest homes I have ever spent any time in. The bed and the room are spacious, comfortable and elegant (in addition to being spotless). The wall separating this bedroom from the living room/kitchen area is of normal height, but does not reach all the way to the very high ceiling. This means that any sound travels clearly between the two areas. Charles is extremely quiet, as were the other guests (there is one other room rented out) so noise coming into my room was never bothersome. I felt self-conscious about making noise myself, however Charles never made me feel bad about making noise and even specifically said it wouldn’t bother him if I had a phone conversation at normal volume at 2am. The parking garage is very convenient. Charles made me a great cup of coffee and muffin on the first morning. The shower/bathroom were very clean and pleasant, as Charles checks on them multiple times a day. The location is within walking distance of Runyon Canyon, which is a very cool place to hike, and there are tons of food places within easy walking distance."

2708,463760810088565114,2021-10-01,11543268,Adele,"Accurate, punctual, precise, Chas is a wonderful host. And the extra attention Chas gives to details will make your stay more than pleasant! <br/>The room is impeccably clean and organized.<br/>I highly recommend this place."
2708,486232162366279290,2021-11-01,9220407,Haile,"Comfortable stay. Extremely clean. If you’re into just relaxing, resting, staying in a clean comfortable room. This is the place. If you’re into small microwave & toaster oven meals this place is perfect but not If you’re cooking, cooking (seasoning meats, mixing, etc.) overall calm, cleanly stay"
2708,517438084003569601,2021-12-14,424880135,Julio,Amazing place to stay in Hollywood! Chas is a superhost!

2708,586244725063977055,2022-03-19,33880315,Michelle,"I really enjoyed staying here.  The description of the place is spot on and Chas is very responsive, if needed.  Overall, I would stay again as it provides a calm, clean and quiet environment.  It was an extra plus to have access to a kitchen since I did stay for 30 days and I didn’t want to have to do takeout every night. Highly recommend.<br/>Best, <br/>Mich"
2708,771125886635921094,2022-11-29,51893738,Kurt,"Charles was a great host, I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at his place. The neighborhood was very walkable, and central enough to be able to get to both downtown LA and to the coast using public transport.<br/>The apartment was always clean, spacious and a pleasure to live in for the month that I was in LA. I work remotely and it was very well suited to what I needed, as the bedroom had a desk large enough to work and take calls from. The bed was comfortable, and Charles was always friendly and willing to help with anything. He was accommodating on both check-in and check-out times, and I'm really appreciative of him allowing me to share his space.<br/>Highly recommend for anyone traveling to LA and looking to stay around the Hollywood area, thanks again!"
2708,871853918823721496,2023-04-17,155646940,Mamoun,"A great host in a great home!<br/>Don’t hesitate, Chas.’s place is just the dream place that appears on the listing. Charles is also a great host, always welcoming and willing to help his tenants. The apartment was always super clean, which was truly important to me. The instructions were super clear, I had the luck to enjoy the sauna, the gym, and the jacuzzi in this very neat building. Also, in terms of location, I could definitely not dream better as this place is perfectly located at the center of Hollywood, about 10min by foot from the TCL Chinese theater.<br/>Charles always made us feel at home, and I couldn’t feel more grateful for that as it was my very first time in LA.<br/>Thanks again for everything. Your kindness and generosity are really unique, and it won’t be forgotten. And I will definitely come back next time I’m in the city of Angels!"
2708,947928431665277962,2023-07-31,502511212,Stephen,"Charles is the man!! Just wrapped up an amazing six-week stay and he went above and beyond throughout to make sure I felt at home. This is a really lovely apartment in Hollywood with well-rounded proximity to greater Los Angeles - obviously LA is vast and sprawling, but this location is central enough that I felt reasonably close to the activities that I wanted to do in West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Downtown, Culver City, La Brea, Los Feliz, North Hollywood, and Burbank. And in case you don't have a car (although I believe this place includes a parking spot!), Santa Monica is an hour-ish bus ride down Santa Monica Blvd. Charles works overtime to maintain this unit and make sure you're as comfortable as possible, all the while respecting your personal space and time. Use common sense/caution when walking around Hollywood, and if you have any concerns about this or transportation or anything, Charles is very easy to reach and eager to help. Had the best time ever here."
2708,1107399330909692945,2024-03-07,201664381,Grant,Great starting point for anyone's LA adventure! Chas always made me feel welcome and at home.

2732,445238,2011-08-14,961293,Nicolas,Louise Diana gave me a very warm welcome ! The place is very clean and ideally situated just a few blocks from Venice Beach. Louise is a very interesting person and her place was like an oasis during my holidays. Go  go go !!
2732,549063,2011-09-19,1131391,Connie,"The bed is a pull out loveseat in the ground level living room, open to the kitchen-there is a wall of windows next to the bed, open with no window treatment-the landing on the stairs looks directly  down onto the bed-the bathroom is on the second level of the townhouse."

<br/>The positive aspect of this experience was the response,"service and help I received from the staff of airbnb. Rachel B and Johnny M went well above and beyond in their efforts to assist me. Thank you airbnb!\"",,,,
2732,1515377,2012-06-19,2248831,Eric,"I had an absolutely fantastic stay with Rev. Dr. Louise-Diana. Her hospitality, kindness, conversations, and helpful information made me feel welcome in her home. The location was excellent it is near everything, from the 3rd Street Promenade to Venice Beach or even the Santa Monica Pier; all the sites are close by. I highly recommend staying with the good Dr. if you’re visiting the Santa Monica area."
2732,1770370,2012-07-22,2756614,Bruno,"Very nice place, very quite, near the beach, near all what you need (restaurants, pubs, supermarkets...). Louise-Diana is a very facinating  and very welcoming person. Don't hesitate, if you want to spend relaxed time, it is the right place with the right person !"
2732,1979159,2012-08-13,2295610,Rebecca,"Louise-Diana was nice and her apartment is in an awesome location (I used to live 3 blocks away yrs ago). However, the pull out love seat bed was unbearable. I canceled my stay the next day and got refunded after sending in photos of the mattress. It's a cheap love seat, maybe 15 yrs old, with metal bars poking your back through the 2 inch, cheap mattress. Fabric is torn in many places as with the matching furniture. I got 3 uneasy hours of sleep."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The apartment is also quite dated,stuffy,and not as nice as the photos and word 'townhouse' seem to impart. I'd charge a bit less for it. Otherwise I'd rate the rest as fair to good. Louise-Diana is cheerful and easy going. With a new bed,she'll be in much better shape. I LOVED my 1st 2 AirBnB experiences in Italy,this makes me more careful when choosing,"and I'll avoid pull-out couches!\""
2732,2554619,2012-10-08,3562921,David,"Louise-Diana is the sweetest gal ever!  She accommodated me extremely last minute with open arms.  Her apartment is beautiful -- she has a beautiful garden right beside the sofa.  Her apartment is a few blocks from the beach, the farm market -- and great shops.  I didn't have a car so I walked everywhere and it was wonderful!  Made a new friend and will definitely stay again when I'm back in town!"

I stay with this lady 3 weeks, she's super nice to me. Looked out for me, was thoughtful with everything, and helped me solve all my problems. In a word,she and her place is the best you can got."

It was very clean and comfortable, quiet and I felt at home since the moment I stepped in. The location was absolutely perfect with the beach just a couple of blocks away, a grocery store to a walking distance, cafes, restaurants and trendy stores just around the corner. Rev-Dr. Louise Diana was very kind, welcoming and sweet. She was very nice to be around and a very thoughtful host. I will definitely stay here when I´m back in Santa Monica! :)"

In ten minutes you are on the beach. From the moment I arrived I felt welcome and at ease. Louise Diana is the perfect host. She respects your space but if ever you need anything she is eager and happy to assist. Will defiantly be staying here if I return to Santa Monica."

2732,52399662,2015-10-29,9228059,Rainbow,"Louise-Diana was kind and accommodating. She'll be there when you arrive, introduce the neighborhood, and make sure you get settled in nicely. If you're lucky you might even get to explore some of the city with her as she's very well connected. The downstairs has great natural lighting and is spacious and comfortable. If you want to get up with the sunrise, you would love this place. Most importantly, this quaint little townhouse is in a prime location - less than 10 minutes' walk from the beach, 15 minutes to the closest grocery store, and 15 minutes to hip boutiques and restaurants on Main Street. There are very few streetlights in this area, though, so you'll want to take caution after dark. Other things to note: There is no air conditioning, fan or heater, and no shelf or wardrobe for storage. Furniture is worn from natural wear and tear and sun exposure over the years. The washer and dryer are in another room several doors down and you'll need to pay to do laundry. You'll also need to buy your own toilet paper and scrub down the bathroom before you leave. It is important to keep clean and organized and ask questions, as Louise-Diana is very particular about how she keeps things and how you take care of her home. But overall, you'll be sharing a space with a wonderfully experienced woman who has some amazing stories to tell, you'll be living in a quiet neighborhood while still being walking distance away from the hustle and bustle, and you'll be able to have an easy, secluded space to rest when you want to relax in the evenings."
2732,83284545,2016-07-02,8240550,Yigal,"First about the hostess.  Louise-Diana is an exceptional hostess.  She's a very gracious, considerate, unique, fun, and well educated energetic powerhouse but at the same time she provides a relaxing environment, in my mind closely analogous to the city of Santa Monica as a whole."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The home is really quintessential Santa Monica living.  Very serene,relaxing,beach,health conscious living that pushes up against a passionate drive for excellence in the quality of life from food to education,the arts and etc..   This aptly describes both her home and Santa Monica as a whole.  For me as I'm starting a new chapter in my life the gestalt of Reverand Dr. Louise-Diana,her supportive energetic presence

En hyggelig lejlighed med højt til loftet, dejligt badeværelse en trappe op. Yoga Priestes var en åben og givende værtinde. Altid gode råd ved hånden, samtidig med at jeg havde en følelse af at være privat. Gå afstand til strand og til shopping muligheder. God tur. Køkken brugte jeg ikke da jeg spiste ude, men der så ud til at der er det der skal være.<br/>Yoga priestess sagde der vil komme ny seng, det er nok det eneste jeg vil ønske.

2732,501542842,2019-08-03,144393977,Yizhou,"I stayed here for 3 months. It’s definitely a good place to stay. Awesome location, very friendly host and the room is good. I would highly recommend if you are here for a small trip."
2732,540558001,2019-10-03,10608849,Alessandra,"For not long periods it can be a perfect place. The position is grate and even if it’s not a private room, if you’re traveling it’s a good place to stay with a private bathroom. You will enjoy the Santa Monica experience and you can ask the host what kind of nice activities are around the area! She is a really particular person so I wouldn’t recommend it for long period like many months where you have to feel “home”."
2732,582821999,2019-12-27,193454295,David,"I enjoyed my stay as I was there for 2 months. I’m in outside sales so I traveled a lot and wasn’t there much during the week. But when I was, it was clean and the outside area was my favorite part of the location. The bed is an air mattress which I wasn’t aware of, but it is comfortable nonetheless. Location is the best part in my opinion. Early<br/>morning runs on the beach is easily accessible. This was my first 2 months in California and she helped me feel comfortable as it was a bit of a culture shock coming from Michigan. I wish her the best."

2732,600760984064663354,2022-04-08,10017421,Kate,"I strongly recommend to my fellow travelers to stay very far away from this listing. <br/>  I booked this room while I was in town for work.  My flight was scheduled to arrive at 9:30pm, and I noted the host’s “no check-ins after 9pm without prior approval.”  Louise-Diana and I spoke on the phone when I made the booking, and I was clear about the late flight, that I would do everything possible to get there on time, and that, as a fellow early-to-bed person, I would understand if my arrival conditions would be a deal-breaker for her.  She said it would be fine, that it was a quiet neighborhood so to please be considerate when I did arrive.  No problem.   <br/>Unfortunately, there were engine problems and my flight was delayed significantly.  Once we were being re-boarded, I messaged Louise-Diana to let her know and ask how I could make this minimally inconvenient to her.   <br/>She wrote back that I could not come anymore - it would be disruptive to her sleep. She recommended I get a hotel.<br/>  I was floored.  I had booked in advance because I didn’t want to have to secure accommodations at the last minute, but now I was being denied entry to a place I had paid to stay at!  At this point, I would have cancelled if it were possible.  <br/>The host offered no apology, did not offer the obvious solution of leaving a key out, and made absolutely zero effort to meet her obligation.  I only wanted the bare minimum of a safe place to stay. <br/>  I wasn’t able to book a hotel during the flight, and so when we arrived at 2am, I took an airport shuttle to a nearby hotel.  They had no vacancies.  Neither did the hotel across the street.  I spent hours walking alone in a city I had never been in trying to find a safe place to sleep.  By 5am, I gave up at just sat in a hotel lobby until Louise-Diana woke up.  I had written her several times during the night to alert her to my situation.  <br/>I contacted AirBnB customer support several times throughout this saga.  We somehow kept getting poor connections or cut off. When I reached a rep, I stated the situation and asked to please be rebooked into an alternative accommodation.  They said that they couldn’t guarantee a refund, but that they would reach out to me with options.  I didn’t hear from them again for several days.  They eventually refunded the cost of my first night.  <br/>Given that I had no other choice and no support from customer support, I eventually checked in to Louise-Diana’s apartment. When I rang the doorbell, she opened the door, arms extended, and exclaimed “The wanderer!” as if my sleepless night was a choice I had made.  If I had had another option, I would have taken it, but by 8am all I wanted was a bed.  <br/>The following points do seem really moot, but once I check in, I was provided with a clean bathroom and private room.  The twin bed was unstable - it would tip over if you sat in the wrong place.  I don’t think it was intended to be used as a sleeping solution.  It was a piece of furniture that folded into three sections (maybe it worked as a chair or chaise lounge when not flat?), and so there were two metal bars that went across it with about an inch of cushion in those areas. This setup might have worked if something had been put in place to stabilize it, and if there had been a mattress topper on top.  The sheets seemed to be clean, but I don’t think that the pillow was washed after a prior guest - it smelled strongly of a man’s sweat.   <br/>Louise-Diana never apologized to me or tried to make it right.  After this experience, I am probably not going to book on Airbnb anymore.  This program only works if people can trust that the company profiting off this platform will have the backs of its customers, and it’s demonstrated that it definitely does not.  I don’t think it’s any more secure than a Craigslist posting.      "

Upon arrival, I realized that it was a situation that I would just have to deal with, or not, since there was nothing that could be done. I inevitably left 2 days prior to the end of my booking because it was too uncomfortable. <br/>- The room is not pictured in the post, and I found out that this was by design. It ended up being in an office, that was full of things wall-to-wall with no space to put your things except for the floor. There was also no bed; it was a chair-futon that had sheets on it. The futon was quite small - I'm 5'7\"\" and my feet hung over the edge - and it was a bit broken"

It has excellent views of the Hollywood sign and of course, its in beverly hills. a 5 minute walk from the Beverly centre, cool melrose ave, the celebrity hang outs of rodeo drive and the ivy. What more could you ask for??? On top of all of that you get one of the most helpful and kindest hosts you could ever ask for in Michael. This guy made everything so easy. The internet was reliable, the apartment was beautiful and it was such a pleasurable six days in LA. Its ridiculously affordable too. We got really lucky. THANKYOU MICHAEL AND AIRBNB.

Not wanting to drive, my only option was to use public transport, Michael very kindly gave me use of his laptop so I could plan my bus routes around the city, without this I would have been struggling! If you are using public transport, this location is for you. You can get to Santa Monica and Downtown on Wilshire Blvd, up to Sunset Strip using La Cienga Blvd, and up to West Hollywood using San Vicente Blvd. The location of the apartment was within a few hundred yards walk to all the above bus stops. The apartment was nice and clean, had all the amenities needed for a comfortable stay, and was located on a lovely street! I would certainly recommend a stay with Michael as he was a very friendly, helpful host and gave me his personal mobile number, if I needed anything! L.A what a city!"

As a host, Shelli-Ann made our stay and my transition moving to LA  a pleasant one. She was extremely friendly, accommodating and responsive to all of our needs from booking to check-out. Upon our arrival, we had a mix up with our car rental so Shelli-Ann even drove us to get groceries and dropped us to the car rental company the next day to sort things out. The guesthouse itself was clean, tastefully decorated and comfortable (I swear the bed feels like you're sleeping on a cloud). Conveniently located near some great restaurants and shopping. Not too far of a drive to the beach and tourist attractions... but far enough away from the busy crowds and noise to have a peaceful night's rest.

<br/>However,the hoste is very kind. She's very willing to help us in need. We've made a 2-nights reservation,and we had to cancel 1 night,"she accepted to repay us without complaining.\"",,

Unglaublich nette und zuvorkommende hosts, entspannte Gäste, chilliges Ambiente, prima kochgelegenheit und sehr gemütliche, um nicht zu sagen ausgefallene Zimmer. Auch die Tatsache, dass wir mit einem Kleinkind gereist sind,stellte kein Problem dar. The Circle wird definitiv wieder unsere Anlaufstelle, sollte es uns wieder mal nach l.a.verschlagen!"

191733,6270848,2013-08-06,5800147,Stacy,We enjoyed our stay in Atwater Village.  The guest house is lovely and the bed is quite comfortable.  Gavin is quite friendly and knowledgeable of nearby restaurants and shops.  It was a overall a nice experience.  We will keep them in mind for future visits.
191733,6725446,2013-08-22,485265,Heather And Anthony,"Little apartment was extremely cute, roomy, clean and Shelli-Anne and her family were lovely. Bed very comfortable. She was very welcoming and helped us with some washing and advice as we were new into LA. We were just in LA for a short but busy time and it made more sense for me to stay with a friend the second night. My Brother who was in town for the night took my place with my friend and they came in late after a night with friends. On second thought I understand how this was disrespectful and I'm very sorry for the noise and inconsideration. Talked with Shelli-Anne after and passed my apology. This is not my usual behavior or situation."
191733,7334571,2013-09-16,5944659,Carol And Larry,Our stay at Shelli-Anne's was wonderful!  Everything was very clean and comfortable.  The kitchen had everything we needed to make some meals.  The bed was super comfortable too!  Shelli-Anne was so nice and helped us to find a good restaurant for a night out!  The location is very convenient to many restaurants.   We highly recommend staying at Shelli-Anne's!
191733,7925330,2013-10-08,8712437,Adam,"I stayed at Shelli-Anne and Gavin's one  bedroom apartment for three weeks and couldn't have been more comfortable. It's a beautiful spot conveniently located in Atwater Village, which has tons of great restaurants, bars and cafés. It's also very close to Los Feliz, Silverlake and a Echo Park. This will be preferred AirBnB rental whenever I'm traveling to LA."
191733,8983325,2013-11-30,1383940,Wendy,"It was Thanksgiving week which was chaotic enough, but Shelli-Anne was there with her two charming little girls, Eva and Ella, to greet us road weary travelers when I knocked on their front door. She was very accommodating letting us park in the driveway to unload the car. The apartment is above the garage at the back of the property that is lushly landscaped with tropical plants - some that have grown two stories tall. There is a small yard at the base of the stairs and a small deck at the rear of the house with a table and chairs for outdoor gatherings."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The apartment was small,but well stocked for any length of stay. There is a flat screen TV,Wi-Fi for your laptop,a wonderful queen size bed and excellent water pressure in the shower which is very important. We needed more towels and I emailed Shelli-anne about it and as soon as I sent it it seemed like she was at out door with a stack of freshly washed towels with an apology that the cleaning lady had not left them for us as she was supposed to do. She was so embarrassed. So if you needed anything at any time all you need to do is email [or call] Shelli-Anne and she will help you if she can. We enjoyed staying in the apartment and learned how to make coffee with a French press for the first time. I looked up the brand name of the french press they have for the directions so I could use it correctly.,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Atwater Village offers you all kinds of stores and restaurants and you can ask Shelli-Anne all about them as she is the expert on this area of Los Angeles. This place is centrally located so getting around to seeing my 95-yr. old uncle for Thanksgiving was easy. Everything looked entirely different in the daytime and I was able to figure out exactly where I was so getting around was not so difficult after that for the rest of the week. We had a great time and the week went by way too fast.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Sadly,we were not able to spend more time with Shelli-Anne,Gavin and the girls. They are really nice people. Very casual and laid back. Easy to get along with. Being from Australia they don't celebrate Thanksgiving so they decided to take a trip to the mountains for a few days. We left before they returned. Atwater is an interesting area I have been interested in knowing more about and Shelli-Anne is apparently very involved in what is going on there so she is the one to ask. Maybe next time. We recommend the Gorgeous Spanish/Modern Guesthouse and think that Shelli-Anne is a wonderful host-ess who is the mostess! Gavin,Eva and Ella are the mostess,too,and their little puppy dog

Even though we were 2,600 miles from home Shelli-Anne and Gavin made us feel like we were right at home.  What a great experience we had.  Shelli-Anne went out of her way to make sure that were a part of the community and she promptly took care of any concerns/questions we had.  We are very grateful to have such wonderful host's as Shelli-Anne and Gavin during our 30 day stay in their lovely guesthouse.  In all of our travels in Los Angeles, nothing felt more like home to us than Atwater Village.  A very nice place to stay."

The space is clean and most everything you would need is available or Shelli-Anne will get it for you.  Be aware that the bed is quite soft, which was tough on my wife's bad back.  We probably should have asked about the mattress prior to renting."

53945,990617,2012-03-12,697930,Lisa,"We loved the feel of having our own home during this visit to LA. Michael is an excellent host, the apartmend is extremely comfortable, it is in a very convenient location and the coffee shop is right next door!"
53945,1006972,2012-03-17,1666897,Victoria,"Michael was extremely courteous. We had some difficulties with our rental car, which affected our arrival time but Michael was still very patient."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The location was great. We could always find parking nearby for our rental car. In addition,"it was close to everything we wanted to go to. The unit was clean and bright. :)\"",,,,
53945,1027153,2012-03-21,1673033,Mark,"Michael's place is in a great location and he was extremely accommodating in meeting with us a little earlier than we had anticipated. The apartment is clean, well equipped and has everything you need. The apartment is within easy walking distance of a coffee shop, a liquor store and possibly the best chinese massage we have had! Would definitely recommend staying here for a Beverley Hills experience, especially if you are walkers like us."
53945,1043343,2012-03-26,1711914,Hayden,Highly recommended.  Very nice apartment in a good location.  Michael is an excellent host and couldn't have been more helpful.
53945,1058234,2012-03-29,1788218,Amy,Michael was very helpful with our booking and friendly upon our arrival. The apartment was clean and in an excellent location to get to many great LA restaurants and activities.
53945,1092608,2012-04-07,692698,Robin,"Michael is very friendly and hospitable. The apartment is comfortable and well-located for most of the things you would want to do in LA, and it's great to have on-street parking."
53945,1127619,2012-04-14,1687081,Phil,"The best thing about this place is the location.  It is convenient to many great things in LA.  I also found the size of the apartment to be more than enough for me and my wife.  The only negative is the smell of the apartment.  There was a dank, musty smell in the building and the unit.  I ended up burning incense and candles to cover it up.  Otherwise this place was great and Michael was very friendly."
5843,201710538,2017-10-08,4860311,Sun,Great location and great vibe.  We had a great stay.
5843,204568536,2017-10-18,3850493,Andrew,"I had a great time - what a cool spot! The house is beautiful, has a very unique and zen vibe, and is located nice and close to Marina Del Rey and not too far from Venice Beach either. Communication with Sanni and Helene was super easy and clear, and it was just a really good stay. Thanks for having me, would stay again for sure!"
5843,206504521,2017-10-25,152591718,Renzo,"Great house, very hip and fun environment with the guests who stayed at the houses keeping the environment lively every day. The house was clean and as advertised."

5843,213057971,2017-11-19,23187542,Katie & Hagan,"We had a nice stay at Sanni's place. It's an charming compound, with several creative buildings and a great big courtyard with interesting decor. The neighborhood is nice, and it's an easy walk to the store; the bike rentals were a nice touch. The construction site next door was unexpected, and every time we used a hairdryer a fuse blew, rendering half the outlets and the Internet unusable. Helene, who helps Sanni host, was very quick to reply and very helpful throughout our stay."
5843,242911493,2018-03-13,94904062,Helle,A beautiful place with great energy - perfect for those who are into alternative living and wellness. The house felt very clean and free of dust (I am prone to allergies and was all good here!). The kitchen was stocked with all sorts of basic ingredients to make it a homely stay - from Apple Cider Vinegar to great teas etc. All beds were comfortable with good linen. Wifi was fast and there was parking available throughout our stay. If you are traveling in a group just be aware that one bedroom is without a soundproof door and is separated from living area by a curtain. We really enjoyed our stay and will recommend!
5843,243355852,2018-03-15,4033317,Aisling,"Was a great space, a home away from home. Very cozy, easy to find, check-in and the unique touches to the home made it special. I loved all the plants around the house.  Would stay again!"

5843,248121562,2018-03-30,25163604,Randy,Close to dining and the beach areas.  Very stylish with some nice touches.
5843,249773969,2018-04-02,19282621,George,"The house is great, simple & stylish. It perfectly hosted 5 people without any issues. Helene was also great with communication. <br/>Please note that you will need a car to travel around!"
5843,250327202,2018-04-04,565495,Alexandra,"Convenient location near Venice Beach and not too far from Hollywood. Quirky residence with a few different buildings on the property. Easy check-in and check-out and good communication throughout. Could use a photo re-fresh as the space now looks and feels different. For example, the exposed roof above the beams in the living room is no longer exposed, but rather covered with cloth. The living room windows now have materials draping on them and the layouts of the rooms have changed (due to re-arranged furniture), etc. As such, the bohemian artist's residence can feel a bit more like 'glamping'."
5843,253218252,2018-04-13,7243990,Hetal,"My family and I stayed at Sanni's place for over a week -it was terrific!!  we really enjoyed Sanni's space -both indoor and outdoor spaces, location was also great.   any issues were fixed immediately and efficiently - i'd absolutely recommend the place to everyone and look forward to staying here again"

191733,40979286,2015-08-03,32230862,Teneil,"My stay at Shelli-Anne's was great. Her home was very comfortable and her house sitter was very nice. Shelli and her family were on vacation but her house sitter was there to greet my friend and I when we arrived and made sure we had everything we needed. Atwater is a really cute place, the farmers market on Sunday is awesome but if you're driving parking is a lil tough. Overall my stay was great, I would stay again."
191733,45799861,2015-09-06,21569503,Paula,Had a great stay with Shelli-Ann and her family.   She was very accommodating and gave us suggestions of places to visit.  felt like part of the family.

Her family is de.igntful and welcoming, even the dog. the listing was accurate and we lacked for nothing. Loved how the house was decorated, backyard very inviting. Neighborhood fantastic.Within walking distance to Atwater Village with cute shops and fab restaurants!"

191733,108292019,2016-10-15,36894456,Eileen,"We were warmly greeted by Shelli-Anne on arrival and given a friendly tour of this very charming and accommodating guest house.  It was bright, airy and well-equipped with everything needed for a comfortable stay, and then some - including a kitchen stocked with coffee, a variety of beverages and many cooking staples (though we did not cook!). Shelli-Anne offered a wealth of information about fun things to do in the surrounding area. By the time we left, we felt like old friends!"
191733,184370529,2017-08-19,10267304,Tara,"Loved my stay at Shelli-Anne's  I stayed there for two months and it truly felt like home. The kitchen has everything you need to make your meals, down to spices, Tupperware, and kitchen utensils. Shelli-Anne has a wealth of information when it comes to the Atwater area and we loved checking out the events she recommended. Would definitely recommend for anyone visiting LA!"
191733,193250274,2017-09-12,9297899,Donna Ruzzano And,"I think all the positive reviews that came before says it all. Shelli-Ann and her family are warm and welcoming. The guest house is perfect for a couple. Unfortunately for us we were there for 2 weeks during a LA heatwave so we didn't get to do the riverwalk or even walk down to Atwater Village which her Guesthouse is very close to, and where she has many places that she suggests to visit.  Shelli-Ann will welcome you with open arms and a wonderful basket filled with just what you need to start the day. She was very kind about having us park the rented SUV in her spot in the driveway especially because it is hard to find street parking. She was always willing to allow us to use her state of the art washer and dryer when we needed, and I appreciate that very much. The guest house is appropriately equipped with all one might need for a short stay. Atwater village is close to Pasadena and Griffith Park, it is a bit of a ride to the beaches but if you don't mind driving on the 405 you can get there in 30 minutes. All in all the village was convenient to where we wanted to be, close to family in North Hollywood,  and a very pleasant place to rest after a full day of visiting LA. Thank you Shelli-Ann for making our stay as pleasant as can be."
191733,228657400,2018-01-20,127737632,Zach,"Shelli-Anne is a great host and always makes my stays feel a little more like home. Great place to stay, can’t go wrong."

5843,291374623,2018-07-15,121979083,Wojciech,"We had a great stay with our 2 daughters: location is perfect for seeing LA & surroundings (if you have a car), close to the airport but really quiet. Place is really originally decorated, it's very clean. Hosts are super responsive. We were slightly surprised how hot it gets (July, no AC), but after the 1st night we got used to it, there are plenty of fans."
5843,293629056,2018-07-20,347848,Julie,"In short Sanni's place was very comfortable, fun & wonderfully quirky place. Great location and FREE PARKING (YIPPEE!)... we had plans to all the theme parks and Museum's - so it is centrally located between all; also close to the Venice canals for evening strolls & ice cream! The place was very clean, charming and we had a lovely time.  Thank you very much! I'd stay there again!  Cheers!"
5843,296884751,2018-07-26,6279889,Michael,"Absolutely loved the space! I wish I could move in full time :) great location - more Marina del Rey than Venice but close to bars and restaurants, etc. Very worth the stay and also a great value compared to some similar locations in the area."
5843,297980574,2018-07-28,42201270,Ashley,"Sanni’s place was perfect for 3 friends just looking to relax and get to know the Venice area! The place was spotless, and comfortable. The backyard was a great space and we enjoyed hanging out and meeting some of the other guests staying in the other airbnbs on the property. I highly recommend staying here!"
5843,300251021,2018-08-01,189510436,Sophia,"This place is what you get when you want a home away from home. Garden is amazing, really quiet, and it has everything you need for traveling. Very quick responses from Helene or Marten made our stay much better. We were a family of five and we enjoyed coming home from extended sightseeing and having fun in LA."
5843,301747993,2018-08-04,28679002,Vincent,L’esprit correspond bien à l’annonce. Cette maison fait un peu « communauté » dans la mesure  ou d’autres logements donnant dans le même jardin sont loués en parallèle. Un peu de promiscuité puisque la SdB du logement et celle du jardin se touchent et partagent la même fenêtre. Sinon ouvre la fenêtre de la SdB du logement on a vue directe dans celle du jardin.
5843,305697521,2018-08-11,180433563,Oliver,Perfect location near Marina Del Rey and to the beaches. Calm and cozy house with a very special Charme

5843,309125172,2018-08-17,5815305,Jp,"Very homy, equipped and characteristic. Windows somewhat hard to operate. Loved the charm and the piano (even if needs tuning -) as well as the outdoors common areas<br/>BBQ could be a little more user friendly!"
5843,311681216,2018-08-21,27267944,Eleanor,"Cute, bohemian place with everything you need for your LA stay. Great communication and good wifi. Nice to be able to relax in the shared garden."
5843,313610093,2018-08-25,77987848,Pam,"The  perfect antidote to  a sterile hotel room. Artistic, eclectic, older home but well maintained. You share the  backyard space with other renters of the outbuildings but it is still serene and private. A bit warm in late August but  the  fans and opening doors took care of  that. Convenient to the freeway but in a quiet neighborhood."
5843,317872114,2018-09-02,75462470,Monica,"overall great trip. The home is near airport which was great, and near beaches. The city is massive be prepared to rent a car, or spend a lot of time traveling to get to destinations."

5843,417280701,2019-02-26,69964575,Kevin,Sanni has a beautiful home that's been turned into a very cool Oasis with 4 different living spaces. The commons area is very relaxing and just a scene in itself. The beds were very comfortable and had all the necessary amenities for a great stay.
5843,419809105,2019-03-04,36053221,Oli,"Sanni's place was very nice, loved the decor around (wooden painted masks, antique furniture etc). I was excited about the piano but it's decoration mostly as it's very old and out of tune (some strings may be broken). There is a separate door to one of the bedrooms which was a nice addition for privacy, the garden and area around are very nice and the home provided everything we needed. Beds are comfy (including bunk beds!). Venice beach is a good location for being close to the beach, the airport and not having to deal with downtown traffic every time you go out. We had no problems, thorough communication for check in. Recommend."
5843,420758809,2019-03-07,4776272,Jen,"A very cute, if Bohemian and spartan, artist retreat. We enjoyed our stay and exploring the surprises in the garden, meeting others staying on the property. Recommended!"

De plus les voisins parlent français et Hélène, votre hôte sur place,  est toujours là quand on a besoin de quelque chose... Que demander de plus?..."

She is a warm, welcoming and extra thoughtful host who was accommodating and easy to communicate with. <br/>The Airbnb itself was a good fit for our family of three. Clean, spacious and with all the amenities for a longer stay. The outdoor area is beautiful, always a such a nice space to come home to. The location is good, walkable to neighborhood’s main drag. Absolutely recommend!"
191733,356299166,2018-12-07,223754175,Brian,We loved staying here !
191733,403439229,2019-01-20,228192706,Shelley,"Hands down the best hosts my sister and I have ever stayed with. Shelli-Anne and her family are a joy to be around. Shelli-Anne goes above and beyond to make sure her guests are happy and comfortable, always checking in cheerfully when crossing paths and giving the best suggestions on what to do, and see, and eat. We could text her at anytime about anything and get a quick and thorough response. When we needed anything extra, ( i.e., umbrellas, yoga mats, coffee) she was there to provide it. The house itself  is adorable and the beds are amazingly comfortable. The area is wonderful as well, only a mile walk from atwater village which is full of great food and cute shops. The neighborhood itself is beautiful and safe and quiet, great for walking around in. Oh and she has a driveway! no need to spend time looking for street parking. Would recommend this to everyone."
191733,406453297,2019-01-29,26373155,Ausrine,Stayed at Shelli-Anne’s lovely place for three nights and loved it. The apartment was super clean and had all the amenities one could wish for. Shelli-Anne and her husband were very friendly and welcoming and provided us with great suggestions of things to do and places to visit in the area. Would definitely recommend staying there!
191733,410799083,2019-02-10,90667373,Amy,"Shelli Anne and I had a little mishap with this booking but somehow, after receiving her email, I was not worried and knew she would make things right. You don't always feel that way! Shelli Anne stayed in contact with me start to finish and made sure everything worked out for me - I cannot recommend her enough. I ended up spending time in Atwater Village as well and it's such a great neighbourhood. See you next year!"
191733,432394820,2019-04-03,74034413,Eloísa,"Shelli-Anne’s place is amazing. It is beautiful and full of light, very private and comfortable. The location couldn’t be better in the heart of Atwater Villlage next to a bunch of little shops and restaurants. She is very kind and always ready to help! Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
191733,437499456,2019-04-14,3767689,Kris,Great place to stay. I’d definitely recommend to friends!
191733,441299039,2019-04-21,240077829,Claudia,"Such a lovely place!!! Super comfortable, stocked kitchen with herbs, spices, oils etc. Shellie-Ann was great to communicate with, prompt replies. <br/>And the bottle of wine in the fridge didn’t hurt;-)<br/>Would definitely stay again."

191733,460198275,2019-05-28,57970775,Paul,I booked this place for my mother while she was in town visiting. It was a wonderful place with nice hosts and very simple check-in!  Thank you!
191733,480937009,2019-07-03,237516110,James,Perfect. Clean. Warm. Welcoming and Stylish. I’d love to live here.
191733,610618458,2020-02-24,19983752,Robert,"This is a wonderful apartment in a superb location!  The hosts are amazing.... felt quite at home from the first!   The apartment is very well appointed; one of the best we have experienced... great amenities, very workable kitchen,  quiet,  loads of space.... I could just go on and on.  Loved it!  We had not been in Atwater Village before, and are now loving the location.  Will definitely be back to our Atwater Village home away from home!"
191733,702398127,2020-10-20,3317517,Brent,"We had a wonderful long stay at the guest house! The property, which is gorgeously planted and has classic LA style, is one of the most beautiful in Atwater. Shelli-Anne is an incredibly gracious host who provided a warm welcome and checked in with us throughout our stay to make sure we had everything we needed. The apartment is just as it appears in photos and was spotless on our arrival. One especially welcome perk was how well stocked the kitchen was with cookware; this really made us feel at home during our extended stay during a time when local dining options were still somewhat limited. Travelers should know that while the guest house is self-contained it is very much part of the compound of a lovely and lively family, and is in a somewhat densely packed residential neighborhood; this lent a happy vibe we enjoyed but which may deter those for whom absolute quiet is a must. It's hard to find good accommodation during the pandemic and we are so grateful for the warm, thoughtful, and safe temporary home this family made for us at their lovely and relaxed property."
191733,714954184,2020-12-12,17435934,Douglas,"Great AirBnB experience! The unit is comfortable and clean and the whole property has a great vibe with the trees and tropical vegetation right outside the windows. The hosts are marvelous--super friendly and accommodating.  The location is great too, lots of great food in the area, minutes from griffith park, etc.  Highly recommend this place, especially for longer stays."
191733,726045727,2021-01-22,43970932,Bradley,"Shelli-Anne’s property is lovely. We had a great month long stay and had everything we needed. The space was comfy, cozy and clean. Shelli-Anne and Gavin are great people and wonderful hosts. They made us feel right at home and we miss them already. Atwater is an awesome neighborhood with lots to do and see. Look no further and book this while you can!"
191733,693606769421470727,2022-08-14,388612452,Eduardo,"We had a fantastic, 10-week stay in Shelli-Anne's Airbnb. Perfect work from home setup with the great desk and air-conditioned living room. Dreamy access to the LA River Bike Path, so this is perfect for cyclists. Atwater Village is a gem of an LA neighborhood and this is a wonderful place to stay."
191733,745825524863222239,2022-10-25,21267483,Monica,"From the moment I booked, Shelli-Anne was warm and communicative. The apartment is in a wonderful part of town, easily walkable to Glendale Ave, close to the river, wonderful restaurants and theaters nearby! Gavin made everything super easy, and having their sweet pup Wally around was a wonderful surprise. I enjoyed my all-too-brief stay immensely."
191733,774074181912480812,2022-12-03,371669682,Nicholas,This was such a great stay. The neighborhood is absolutely amazing surrounded by great restaurants. Shelli-Anne was such a great host and everyone in her family were so kind and welcoming. We can’t wait to book our next stay with Shelli-Anne.
191733,892169401704105720,2023-05-15,5663890,Irina,"Shelli-Anne and Gavin’s place in Atwater Village was a true delight.  I was there for a semester-long stay for a teaching stint at CalArts.  They were most gracious and kind hosts, bringing me 2 lbs of coffee on my second day, giving me great tips about the neighborhood, and answering any questions I had. <br/>Their place is cozy and comfortable (about 400+ square feet), perfect for a single person or couple. It’s behind their charming main house and surrounded by beautiful cacti, bougainvillea, and jasmine.  There is wonderful large desk for working.<br/>I can’t imagine more wonderful hosts! And Atwater Village is great neighborhood where you don’t need a car everyday.  It has a fabulous variety of food and a delightful (organic and conventional) farmers market every Sunday with a food truck making the best pupusas ever!"
191733,947896747461755833,2023-07-31,79134796,Peter,"We really enjoyed our stay with Shelli-Anne and felt at home right away. The apartment had everything we needed for our one month stay, the bed was very comfortable, the kitchen was well laid out and stocked and the bath was clean and functional. We highly recommend this apartment!"
191733,1008109243192789359,2023-10-22,104398694,Ramya,Excellent hosts- very responsive and accommodating of any requests you may have. Great local recommendations and made sure to check on me if I had any concerns about the place.
191733,1048030996383533680,2023-12-16,5278558,Drew,Truly comforting and enjoyable to know that some people on AirBnB still care about their guests comfort and stay. The kitchen was VERY well equipped and things like sheets/towels/TP/etc were nice and enjoyable to use. <br/>Shelli-Anne and Gavin are very kind and gave us lots of recommendations while we stayed with them.
5843,444306165,2019-04-27,41480201,Louisa,Can’t be beat value for the location with great outdoor spaces. Prompt communication. Clean. And beach gear!
5843,445060441,2019-04-28,212175289,Myhanh,This location was very relaxing to stay at. We felt like we were on a retreat somewhere far away from Los Angeles. I loved how the home felt cozy and lived it. It was spacious enough for 5 guests to fit very comfortably. I would definitely book this again!
5843,446980432,2019-05-02,225198774,万里,お世話になりました。初めてのロサンゼルスでしたが快適に過ごすことができました。お庭の植物が植えてあって綺麗です。近くに公園やお店があるので便利です。家具もレトロなものが多くて素敵なおうちでした。

5843,452293601,2019-05-12,30995664,Kirti,"Sanni's place is at a great location, 20 minutes from the airport and less than 10 minutes from the Venice beach. Almost everything that you will need for your stay is available in the house and most importantly the co-host Helene is super responsive and accommodating. The house has a very earthy feel to it with a lot of natural light coming in from skylights. Throughout the house, you will find knick-knacks left by previous travelers or occupants that give it a very lively feel.<br/>The outside common area is a great place to simply relax or chit-chat with occupants of the other apartments within the same compound.<br/>Overall a comfortable cozy experience!"
5843,453416996,2019-05-15,2028679,Christopher,Great host and a lovely stay

5843,462058097,2019-06-01,189430997,Leah,"A very beautiful space, the pictures don’t do it justice. We had a photo shoot here and during our three day stay it was very easy to get around the city. We appreciated the kitchen and the spacious rooms. Overall had a 5 star time"
5843,463155255,2019-06-02,257240956,혜리,it was good place!  and there's no kettle !

5843,468147371,2019-06-11,195527246,Tony,Very nice and quiet vibes would book again if I was staying in the area.
5843,472472682,2019-06-19,167178348,Rachael,This place was everything we needed . It comfortably hosted four adults and a toddler. We really appreciated the kids toys and books. The common area outside was very relaxing. Everything about our stay was great! It was very convenient to have easy parking as well.

53945,1282928,2012-05-15,1670368,Ingrid,"Michael is a wonderful host. His correspondence is prompt and courteous also full of tips and tricks to make your stay enjoyable. Michael's  wonderful, artsy apartment was perfect: cozy and centrally located. We really enjoyed having all the comforts of home at our fingertips, including washer and dryer in the building and especially the convenience of having a kitchen (which was stocked with all sorts of extras: coffee, tea, spices, water and other goodies in the fridge). The convenience of wi-fi was also a plus. We arrived earlier than he normally checks folks in, but he graciously allowed us to call him from the airport and met us within 30 minutes. The apartment's location in The Beverly hills district was fantastic. There is an abundance of all types of restaurants, shops, bars and the like within a 5 block radius.  Overall a great experience and a steal for the price and location. Thanks Michael."
53945,1307249,2012-05-20,1628581,Rodrigo,"Great place, great location and great host!"
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>We were looking for something well located to stay in L.A. or in Beverly Hills,but the hotels were very expensive. At first we were concerned about renting a place,as this was our first time,but this proved to be a great experience in every way possible and all thanks to Michael.,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The apartment is very neat and cozy,you will find everything you need there. Michael was even kind enough to leave us food and some beverages,but most important he was an excellent host regarding the attention and care he showed us. Michael’s apartment is a place where you can actually live in,"I would if I had business in the area or for our next vacation.\"",,
53945,1344065,2012-05-25,1556039,Catherine,"Michael is a wonderful host.  Warm, kind, courteous and professional.  The apartment is just what we needed--a clean, cozy, well-stocked apartment from which to explore L.A.  Michael was kind enough to accommodate our 2 month old son who was traveling with us.  Thank you, Michael!  We'll be back."
53945,1398118,2012-06-02,680532,Zelda,Michael was an excellent host.  I loved that he took care of every bit of detail to make our stay comfortable.  His apartment is presented in exactly the same way as shown on the pictures. It is very central and I enjoyed my power walk to Rodeo Drive every morning.   His place was my home away from home and I am missing it already.  Michael thank you so much for your kindness and for your hospitality and I look forward to staying at your again.  I will definitely keep in touch!!!
53945,1441485,2012-06-09,1743936,Julie,"Hi Michael, Thank you very much for your warm welcome. We had a great time in the apartment and Los Angeles is amazing. The apartment and the neighborhood is very nice, clean and quiet with everything we need in the apartment. It's a very good location with a lot of buses. :-) You are helpful and a kind and friendly host and take care about our safely. We'll come back!!"
53945,1547199,2012-06-24,2026757,Rick,Michael was a great host and everything went smoothly...

5843,487166171,2019-07-13,172043629,Jasenka,"We enjoyed being close to the beach. It is a small, very clean place with good energy. There is room for improvement in decoration, the place can be utilized better."
5843,491842218,2019-07-20,29248919,Judy,"Exactly as described, the place is a peaceful oasis in LA. The neighborhood is calm but near to the beach (5-7 min) drive and there is a place nearby in walking distance where you can find everything you need (groceries, gym etc...). The beautiful garden is shared with the other guests so we met very nice people! The house is really comfortable, the WiFi works great... we had a wonderful stay!"
5843,508916187,2019-08-13,149830323,Hideaki,great!
5843,510231947,2019-08-15,29722298,Ciprian,"The space is peaceful but not very close to Venice Beach as described.  If you prefer sleeping in total darkness (as I do), prepare to carry an eye mask as there is a roof window just above the bed that streams in the sunlight."
5843,513620036,2019-08-19,26394238,Axel,"Schnelle, unkomplizierte Kommunikation, man ist schnell in Venice, Nahversorgung nur ein paar Autominuten entfernt."
5843,516686165,2019-08-24,181818325,Harriet,This place is in a peaceful location. It reminded us of some of the traveller style places we’ve stayed in round the world in the 80s and 90s... which we liked!
5843,519031403,2019-08-27,9831031,Angelica,"Sanni & Helene's home is a gourgeus cottage in LA, very close to Venice, in a quiet and peaceful environment! It was a perfect place for our last 3 days in LA, and we wished we had another day to simply enjoy the house! Very clean and well equipped, it feels just like home!<br/>Helene was very clear, understanding and helpful throughout our stay! We surely reccomend this LA house for brief or longer stays!"
5843,523023040,2019-09-02,162533268,Abby,"This was a great location - just as easy to get to Venice Beach as it was to get to LAX. This house has tons of charm and we loved the cheerful colors throughout. Check in was easy, and communicating with the hosts was a breeze. Definitely recommend!"
5843,532955715,2019-09-20,65120136,Michael,I work 50+ hours a week in the go go rat race of the world this place is on another level of relaxation.
5843,534465295,2019-09-22,244203586,Alexis,Nice spot to air bnb
5843,538363435,2019-09-29,6776115,Tanc,"I had my parents stay here for five nights. We really liked the place. It had a slight hippy feel about it which reminded me of Australia.<br/>Cons; <br/>There was a musty odour to the entire place which we attribute to being a mix of it being locked up and old fabric(curtains etc)/books inside.  Airing out the place helps quite a bit however your privacy is then compromised as there are other airbnb guests on the property. One window directly opens to an outdoor bathroom other guests use. <br/>The place was hot, almost uncomfortably hot. If you're going in summer and you run hot this may be an issue. Any other time of the year I'd say it's fine. <br/>Security; A spare key was left out, which I assume anyone who stayed there before would know where to find. We immediately removed it for safety sake.  With other guests on the property (I assume backpackers) it was something we kept in the back of our mind. <br/>Pros<br/>Host was great. Pics accurately describe what you're getting. The place has an open/community feel about it. Lots of natural light. Two fans provided to combat the heat.<br/>Summary. At $200 a night (all in) you could stay at the Marriot. We chose the airbnb for its proximity to friends who lived in the neighbourood, and the ability to use the kitchen and prepare cooked meals. Would my parents stay there again? Yes. They're easily pleased, have done a lot of outdoor camping. It was rustic, and had a granola type vibe.  Would my wife and I stay there? Probably not. She likes a little more of the comfort factor. Overall, it's clean and simple. you get what's described. 4 out of 5 stars. :)"
5843,541744095,2019-10-05,26978230,June,"The house is very warm and cozy  in a quiet neighborhood, 1 mile walk can take you to a Plaza for food and shops. The garden is big shared with guests from Zen room, Hobbit room, and Tiny room. So you can meet different people. <br/>If you are an early sleeper and waker it is a perfect place for you, vice versa.  Because the house is bright with natural light from the ceiling window in the master bedroom and windows around.<br/>A great experience!"
5843,542857432,2019-10-06,3885841,Joyce,A lovely place with lots of sun and plants just a 10min drive from Venice Beach. Enjoyed the eclectic place with its little decorative touches. Easy check-in and out. There were other people staying in the compound but we felt safe and secure. Would recommend!
5843,546664549,2019-10-13,293429172,Lynn,A true oasis.
5843,551986082,2019-10-20,172681484,Isaiah,"Great place to stay! Helene was an excellent host and her place was definitely a sight to see. The location is perfect for everything, many places surrounding it, and most importantly Venice Beach wasn’t far at all! Helene was very very responsive and provided us with lots of toiletries, towels/rags, coffee, water, you name it! Neighborhood was wonderful and the creative setup of her house was even better! Would definitely book her again! Thanks Helene!"

5843,567475830,2019-11-22,25550200,Junaid,"Clean and a beautiful place, host is really on top of everything and easy to communicate with. Would definitely rent again."
5843,570509064,2019-11-29,741196,Vineet,"Once upon a time, AirBnB was all about staying in interesting, cozy, charming homes with character hosted by real people. Well Sanni and Helene’s home is EXACTLY that. One of the most charming, fun, cozy, and hip places I’ve ever stayed at. The whole place had a very cool funky (not in the sense of being grungy, more in the sense of being delightfully off-beat) vibe. We also really appreciated the spiritual energy throughout the home.<br/>The aesthetics of the whole home are just lovely— it is clear that  <br/>the host is an artist who treats the home as a canvas upon which to imprint her style.<br/>The location is great—close to LAX, downtown LA, Culver City, etc.but still quiet and reflective. Check in and check out instructions were a breeze to follow and Helene (Sanni was away) was very responsive. <br/>We stayed in the main house which was perfect for our family of 4. We also peaked in to the other spaces on the property—the tiny house, the zen room with a floating bed, the adorable “hobbit house” underground. They all looked really great, especially for those looking to “rough it” a little bit while staying in the LA area. <br/>Venice Beach was hardly a 12 minute drive away and definitely worth being close to. <br/>Loved staying here and would highly recommend it to others!"
5843,571009461,2019-11-30,35641436,Maureen,Great stay!
5843,574800742,2019-12-08,157445036,Sara,Sanni’s place was incredibly peaceful and was a unique environment that we enjoyed very much. It is close to Venice Beach as well as to some really fun shops and amazing options for food. The space was welcoming and we had the opportunity to taste oranges fresh off the tree in their yard! Such a lovely experience and would love to return for another stay at some point!
5843,577731353,2019-12-15,80981452,Stephanie,Good location. House got quite cold (we went in December) and worth noting that the microwave and washing machine is outside and shared with guests staying in the other units in the backyard.
5843,581344965,2019-12-24,183280603,Dhimas,Great place! Nice artistic touch also easy to move location!<br/>Host give us earlier check in time which is great!<br/>This house is full of amenities to cook...😍<br/>We have lots of luggages so its a bit difficult to move in and out of the house due to gravel entrance and bits of steps up to the house.<br/>Other than that its recomended to stay in this place!
5843,584945994,2019-12-30,155833819,효정,Sanni’s house was cozy and clean. It was a bit far from place to place but only 20min around the place. It was good stay!
5843,590124604,2020-01-07,172057893,Hilda,Super neat place. Felt very safe & satisfied while staying here. Hosts were very nice & easy to communicate with.

5843,608461700,2020-02-20,9552135,Hugo,"Funky place, quite close to Venice. We didn’t meet Sanni nor Helene but the communication was smooth and everything was as described."
5843,610591987,2020-02-24,111090022,Monica,This house has a lovely garden. Other than dining room chairs there is no couch or comfy chairs to sit on and there is no TV. The house was clean but needs some updating.

5843,619218557,2020-03-16,24021597,Alex,"Wonderful experience at the Circle, lots of sunlight in the house and surrounded by beautiful plants. Sanni and Helene were very hospitable. Our only remark for future guests: there is no paved path to the entrance. One of us had mobility issues, was difficult for them to walk on the gravel and roots to the door."

53945,1745675,2012-07-19,173889,Mary,"A cozy apartment in a very conveniently located older building - easy access to LA County Museum, the Grove and the Fairfax Market to the East, Beverly Hills/Rodeo Drive, etc. to the West, the Beverly Center, 3rd Street and the Design Center to the North.  We were going to rent a car but instead walked, took buses and hitched rides with local friends instead.  If you're sensitive to noise, be aware that you are fairly close to an intersection that gets busy in the early morning.   We used earplugs at night so it was no problem.  There's a mini-mall very near with a Coffee Bean, a liquor store and a laundry/dry cleaners."

53945,3177026,2012-12-29,409564,Amanda,"My mother and I stayed in Michael's apartment for a week over Christmas.  Michael was a remarkably generous and flexible host.  He responded promptly to all my emails and worked with us down to the wire to arrange a meeting time at the apartment when multiple flights were cancelled/rebooked.  In short, he made holiday travel chaos much easier, regularly offered to accommodate our precarious schedules, and was absolutely gracious in all of his communications.  Our stay was also very fairly priced.  The apartment itself showed a few signs of wear and tear, especially in the bathroom/shower, but it's clear that Michael is very thoughtfully trying to keep those things in good shape despite a steady stream of guests.  Altogether, for the location, hospitality, freedom and ease of access we enjoyed, I couldn't recommend another place that offers such good value for the money.  Highly recommended, especially for 1-2 travellers looking for a nice night's sleep and bright kitchen space to enjoy breakfast before heading out to explore LA-- and for a cozy place to come home to and enjoy a glass of California red in the evening!  Thanks, Michael!"

His place was clean and centrally located. Food/coffee shops were within walking distance, parking was a breeze with the parking permit that was provided.

53945,74752875,2016-05-16,67459237,William,I stayed at Michaels apartment with my partner with very short notice. Michael was very helpful arranging for someone to meet us and provide the keys to the apartment.<br/>The apartment is in a perfect location with parking which is a bonus. It is very spacious and perfect for 2 people. The only downside is the bathroom needs a makeover and a new mattress wouldn't go a miss.<br/>Apart from that the apartment is perfect and I would stay here again if these 2 issues were updated.<br/>

<br/>The space is comfortably modern,very clean,and filled with light - something any northerner or east coaster will notice immediately.  If you're traveling for and extended period you'll truly appreciate the private car park,walking distance to best restaurants in Venice Beach,heated floors for any cool mornings,not to mention the fireplace on the upper patio to enjoy some wine by at night.

<br/>Michael is a great host who is on-hand if you have a question or need a recommendation and otherwise leaves you to enjoy your stay!,,,,,

61578,3358764,2013-01-16,4552054,Oliver,"We had a brilliant stay at Space B.  An amazing apartment which has been diligently designed and thoughtfully furnished with a true modern Southern Californian design aesthetic. There's a real sense of openness and tranquility in the flat with lots of light from the large windows and skylights framing the view of Abbot Kinney Blvd, the palm trees and brilliant blue skies."
<br/>   The owner Michael is a friendly and personable landlord who was on hand if needed and ensured we settled into CA lifestyle with great ease.,,,,,
<br/>   AK is a fantastic location with the immediate Blvd hosting a diverse selection of cafes,restaurants,bars and shops.  One of the few areas in LA where you can find such a local,communal upbeat feel all within strolling distance.  There's also a Wholefoods 10 mins walk away for a bit of thoroughly middle class grocery shopping!,,
<br/>   Venice Boardwalk and Beach are a stones thrown from Space B and a quick 20 min jolly up Main St with it's selection great shops and bars will take you to Santa Monica.,,,,,

We hope we can go back there next time we're in California, were we visit family every so often. Lovely cafeterias and juices steps from the house. It's open terraces and airy design make all the difference."
61578,40364007,2015-07-30,38003121,Shaikha,This place was beyond our expectations! We loved the simplicity and openness of the structure. It's great for a a couple and their friends. The terrace is great for hosting. We really loved staying there. Linens and towels were new and clean. It felt like we were staying in a hotel. Would stay there again with a heartbeat.
61578,56167778,2015-12-09,25815567,Rolando,"Michael was great, he made everything seamless. The location doesn't get any better anywhere in Venice. The house was perfect, the design is clever with a number of great indoor and outdoor spaces. The heated polished concrete floors and the roof top with deck chairs, succulent garden and a gas fire place were my personal highlights. I'm not sure how old the place is but it felt brand new. Will definitely stay here again."
61578,58525867,2016-01-03,337024,Scott,"This space is exactly as listed. Very modern, minimalist, but not too much so that it felt empty. Really tastefully done and came with great little luxurious touches (stocked Aesop products everywhere, nice ceramic dishes, super soft towels). Above all, the location is what's most excellent. For anyone who's spent time in LA, or lived there, this is pretty much exactly where you dream to be. Walk out the door, grab a good coffee, a meal, or a beer, enjoy the sun and shop and stroll. Michael was also super responsive and welcoming. Nothing more to say, really. Great spot. Perfect for two couples."
61578,59943430,2016-01-17,20216370,David,"Michael is a wonderful and professional host. He was extremely responsive and sensitive to our needs. The location couldn't be better. Abbot Kinney is a fantastic street--interesting and exciting. We went the incredible bakery downstairs everyday. Micheal's property is also a remarkably well designed and comfortable place. If you would like to know what it is like live in real architecture, do yourself a favor and stay here."
61578,97436672,2016-08-27,12115251,Nicolette,"Could not have been better for our likes and needs. Space A was the perfect dwelling for our tribe. The photographs, while lovely, fail to convey the wonderful distribution of space and the seamless connection between indoors and out. Highly polished cement floors, beautiful wooden stairs, tons of glass and light and interior courtyards, catwalks and terraces abound. Walk outside and you are in the heart of Abbott Kinney, steps from all the great coffee, restaurants and interesting shops and a short, bracing ride to the beach and boardwalk."
<br/>Although we did not meet face to face,Michael was nonetheless a charming and genial host... Nice towels,great beds and linens and very clean and organized. I am fastidous and I absolutely loved....,,,
<br/>If you like Venice Beach,are into modern California architecture and appreciate a miniamalist aesthetic (and don't mind a bunch of stairs) this place could not be more clean,comfortable,"well situated.  We have every intention of staying there next year!\"",,

194809,6603830,2013-08-18,8072791,Roger,Michele was a very nice lady.  She carefully and clearly explained how the whole check in process worked and it went by without a hitch.    She even told me the best places to find parking late at night.  I'd recommend her for sure.

194809,20494115,2014-09-30,17857716,Samina,We stayed at Michelle's place for two months. Her place is located in Palms/Culver City an area that we felt was calm and safe. Very close to public transportation and there are also many restaurant and shops within walking distance. Michelle was very polite and it was easy to get in touch with her. She really strives to best take care of her guests.
194809,35019399,2015-06-14,27709791,Justin,"The description is very accurate - the place is very large for a 1 BR apartment.  It also had great outdoor space which is great to have in LA.  It is located on a quiet street within walking distance of stores, restaurants, coffee shops, etc."

194809,41428998,2015-08-07,29293315,Krysta,Michelle's place is great. Extremely handy location and in a safe area. I highly recommend.
194809,64256713,2016-03-01,591902,Erin,"Ive stayed a lot of places and never left a negative review. But I cant in good conscience recommend this experience. The listing and photos are very inaccurate. The photos are stretched and distorted to make the space look much bigger than it is and to hide the fact that it's old and has tons of cardboard boxes stacked in every available space. The photo of the bedroom looks spacious when in reality is much smaller and half the room was taken up by the paintingand cardboard boxes toppling all over each other behind it. That said it does have a bed so if you don't need much room for a suitcase it will suffice. The bed looked made until we realized not only was there no top sheet, the yellowed spit covered pillows didn't even have pillow cases. The bathroom was fairly clean except the only thing in it was 1 towel and a really nasty dirty old bar of soap. The patio had obviously not been cleaned in a very long time and there were old boxes and piles of rusty junk. When I asked the host about the patio she said she didn't bother cleaning it because she never went out there (then don't advertise it!) She then asked us for an additional cleaning fee and insisted we replace every product we use in the house, from each Ziploc and tissue to toilet paper. She also wanted to arrange multiple times for us to be home so she could bring someone in to take care of various issues. Less than ideal when trying to enjoy your vacation. The place, while not like in the photos, is livable, I was most disappointed by Michelle. Her response in our conversation was that she was out of state. If she wants good reviews she has to pay for and designate someone to tend to the place while she's away. I really felt she did not see us as guests deserving respect and gratitude for paying her a significant amount of money but instead someone little better than homeless people who should fall at her feet for letting us stay there. Weve stayed multiple times in airbnbs and have hosted ourselves multiple times. Being a good airbnb host means providing AT LEAST clean towels, sheets and toilet paper and making sure the space is clean and free of excess junk. I don't think Michelle grasps this concept."
194809,92595857,2016-08-09,2784307,Thomas,"This is a perfect place for a single or couple that wants to be close to Venice Beach, Santa Monica Pier, etc or has business in the area. A car space is available, but public transportation (bus, train) is closeby and frequent.  There are also great restaurants like Gloria's Mexican and the famous Govinda's Vegetarian just a few blocks away. The neighbor is safe and quiet. The bed and bedding were super comfortable, wifi strong, and a/c cooled the place off quickly. I would definitely recommend and book again."
194809,101206496,2016-09-12,994321,Evan,"Michelle's apartment was great to visit and stay in. She provided me a way to check-in without any problems despite flying into the city late on a Sunday night, and the apartment was clean with tons of space. Multiple air-conditioners keeps the place super cool despite the LA heat and there was plenty of table space to use while staying there in addition to the bedroom. The bathroom was also well stocked and ready for my visit. Overall, it was a great trip at a completely unbelievable price for the area."

Debra was very helpful with getting me oriented to where I was in LA. This was my first time to the city and being able to stay in a quiet residential neighborhood where I could walk to so many things was perfect for me. When I did need to get in the car, I was pleased that I was so close to Venice Beach, Santa Monica and other locations. There was also a household cat which made this cat person feel all the more welcome. I would stay here again."

Homemade breakfast is offered, although as a student who commutes to downtown everyday I didn't have much chance to sit down with them in the morning until my very last day of stay. Room was very clean and they changed the bedsheets for me halfway thru my 2-week stay, which was really sweet and thoughtful. The house cat is very sweet too, willing to spend as much or as little time with you as you'd prefer. Parking was very easy as open curbside spaces were abundant. Neighborhood was very quiet and friendly, but with all the nice grocery stores and restaurants within 5 minute drive. Communication was especially great! I was out of town on the weekend of my checkin date, so I checked in almost two days late, but Debbie was very prompt through text responding and calling. My late checkin certainly caused them some inconvenience, but they were so friendly and forgiving! Thanks Debbie and Rick! Highly recommend for everyone!! :)"

195229,295095014,2018-07-22,22600499,Melissa,"Lovely home in a great location. Debra always made sure to check-in and see if I needed anything. Loved the option to have continental breakfast in the morning. It almost felt like I was at a family member’s place. I’d recommend for anyone looking for a quiet, quaint, bedroom."
195229,314479373,2018-08-26,210410128,Mariko,I'm glad that I chose this place. The house is spacious and quiet with a large garden. Chatting with Debbie and Rick over breakfast every morning was relaxing and enjoyable.

I liked that. <br/>House in bedtown, so you should think how to move here and there if you don't rent a car."

I made a last minute reservation and Debbie was very gracious and let me check-in a little early. She even put some lovely fresh flowers in the room. The property is a true LA gem. Shopping and the freeway are close by, but you feel like you are in a tranquil oasis, when you are inside the home. The room has everything that you will need to have a comfortable and enjoyable stay and your host is very kind and accessible. Many thanks for a great stay!"

195229,600053008486145759,2022-04-07,35503905,Jehan,Staying with Debra was fantastic. She made sure I felt at home and did everything to accommodate me. The house is in the beautiful Mar Vista neighborhood with lots of shops and restaurants close by. It was very easy to get work done there with the fast wifi and quiet setting. If you want a relaxing stay on the west side of LA I recommend you check out Debra’s place!
195229,602175368995907488,2022-04-10,22505609,Karen,I had a wonderful stay at Debra's place. The room and neighborhood are lovely and check-in was a breeze. Debra was communicative throughout as I had to check in earlier than planned. Would definitely stay again!

196410,670105,2011-10-27,1334379,Michele,"The Little Villa in Echo Park is one of the cutest places I've stayed.  It is impeccably clean and beautifully decorated.  Just the right size with amazing views of the L.A. downtown skyline.  Phoebe is charming and lovely to deal with.  The location is great too - a coffee house around the corner, a sweet little food shop, lots of restaurants and a park close by.  I will definitely stay there again."
196410,688226,2011-11-02,544239,Stephanie,"My stay at the Little Villa in Echo Park was nice overall. The living / sleeping space is quite beautiful (with brand new bed & linens) and the neighborhood is great - nearby unlimited eateries, vintage boutiques & shopping, famous LA tattoo shops, public transportation and tons of authentic local culture! Check-in could have been better as the listing had not been fully cleaned or prepared so some flexibility was required. The bathroom & kitchen also need some minor adjustments (bathroom window needs curtain, side doors need repair) and finishing touches to really make the place shine. The walls are on the thin side so you do hear the neighbors moving about & talking (and on the outdoor patio late into the night) so I would definitely describe the space as more lively than peaceful. The host, Phoebe, is a delight, total free spirit and has some interesting travel background of her own. Overall this is a great place for the younger, artistic, open minded type who really wants to experience LA, outside of Hollywood."
196410,759165,2011-12-02,1341417,Heidi,I stayed at the Little Villa for a month while in LA for a job. This was the perfect little pad to experience LA from.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>First on the host: Phoebe was great. She was responsive,helpful and even saved me from getting a parking ticket one morning when I forgot that it was a street cleaning day. Great host.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The apartment is cozy,lovely and has plenty of closets and storage if you're doing a longer stay like I did. I saw on earlier reviews some comments about noise - no it's not insulated that well but I didn't find that the people who live there are that noisy so I was never bothered by the noise in the month I was there. There's plenty of parking on the street,good kitchen if you're planning to whip up your own meals and the view is beautiful. The neighborhood was great - charming little cafes are within walking distance and scored some seriously great vintage finds at the shops in the neighborhood. Overall,"I had a great experience there. \"",,
196410,843334,2012-01-06,1275563,Janus,"The Little Village is a nice apartment, the view is amazing, and the area suited us perfectly. You have anything you need in this area, really good cafées (The Fix, 20 minutes walk from the apartment), amazing Vegan restaurant (Sage Vegan Bistro, 10 minutes walk), nice bars (El Prado, The Gold Room, 10 minutes walk), Music venue (The Echo / The Echoplex, 10 minutes walk), a small eco food market (don't remember the name, but it is just down the corner, 2 minutes walk), shopping possibilities just down on Sunset Blvd. (10 minutes walk)."
<br/>This is the only area I have visited in LA,where you actually don't need a car.,,,,
<br/>Phoebe was very easy to deal with - she was flexible and smooth when we had some troubles with both arrival and departure. Very helpful - she advised us about the things to do to in the area,or places to visit,and she even lented us two bikes,which was very useful in the area.,,
"<br/>A great experience. And we would definitely stay there again next time in LA.\"",,,,,
196410,878321,2012-01-23,1021729,Nita,"Phoebe was kind, responsive and even loaned me a hairdryer and iron! Cute apartment. I would stay there again."
196410,886228,2012-01-27,490613,Jenna & Anthony,"This little apartment is nice and gets the job done. Phoebe was a friendly host who was attentive when I needed her, but left me to privacy otherwise. The view from the studio bedroom is pretty (especially with nice sunsets!) The apartment itself was a little older and rough around the edges. I understand about the policy to not be able to enjoy the deck unless you are staying for a month, but it's a bit of tease because the deck/view is lovely and really expands the little studio. I would say that is the highlight actually. Other than that, it was an overall enjoyable experience."
196410,899554,2012-02-03,313509,Jesse,"My girlfriend and I loved staying in Phoebe's super cozy Little Villa apartment. The view from the bedroom of the hills and downtown LA is superb and she has done an excellent job making the room feel very welcoming, complete with a meditation pillow and buddha. The location was also great -- very convenient to anywhere on the east side."
196410,908230,2012-02-07,1663934,Sara,"Phoebe's Little Villa apartment was a safe, clean and cozy experience. Phoebe was a great host, very accomidating.

<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Really close to grocery store,bars,coffee shops. And 5 minute walk to Sunset - which is incredibly handy if you're taking the bus everywhere. The neighborhood felt really safe.,,,

The location is excellent, with ample parking and public transportation readily available.  Phoebe was a great host...she was very prompt with her approval and with all of our communications.  I recommend staying here."
196410,1326205,2012-05-22,1890797,Jamie,Terrific location.Charming decor.The space itself is very functional for two guests but the bed is a bit small for two people.The kitchen is equipped with enough amenities although we barely put it to use during our visit due to the availability of fantastic restaurants nearby.It's disappointing that the outdoor patio isn't available for guests unless they are staying for a month because it affords a great view and is quite spacious.Phoebe is a gracious hostess and provided us with directions and insight into local restaurants and farmer's markets.We came and went as we pleased during our stay at this quiet and quaint location.
5843,621481867,2020-03-31,9406013,Matt,I love this place. The property is so cozy and has such unique character -- and it's a great value.
5843,654933855,2020-08-22,50491424,Avishai,"Loved The Circle and Sanni's Place, and Helene's hospitality. Chill atmosphere in the Circle Complex, well lit, spacious house, fully equipped kitchen, lovely and sunny garden for outside dining. Good location - you'll need a car, like anywhere else in LA, but then it's a 5 minute drive for any groceries, 10 minute drive to the beach. Wish me and my 8yo could stay longer :)"

196410,2082130,2012-08-24,2972900,Brooke,"\"The Little Villa may give the impression that its small, but its large in comfort and coziness. The space is perfect for two. The villa is located in an interesting Spanish inspired building with a large front deck. You walk up about 15 steps to the door and enter immediately to the kitchen area and then to the right is a small hallway that connects the kitchen and bedroom with the bathroom in between, its a nice separation of space. The bedroom has an office, we made it into a closet/changing area, it was great to have our stuff in there versus sprawled all over the bedroom. There are lots of windows to open to let in fresh air and the choices of lights and dimmers to create your mood really did make it feel like your space for your time there. Parking is easy, please note there is street cleaning on Thursdays and Fridays (8a-10a). You are truly within walking distance to Sunset and a small coffee shop about a block down on Echo Park Ave where you can get breakfast/coffee. There is a fantastic restaurant about 2 blocks from the villa called Red Hill, if you need a local night, I highly recommend here. I cant say enough good things about this place. And Phoebe was wonderful and accommodating to any questions or requests. You couldn't ask for a better set up. I would pick \"\"The Little Villa\"\" over a hotel without hesitating. Especially if you want to be closer to Silver Lake/Echo Park. Hotels seem to cluster together in touristy parts of the city and who wants to feel like a tourist? Best of luck on your trip and please feel free to contact me directly with any other questions. \""
196410,2207116,2012-09-05,3069941,Marcelle,We had a good stay once we conquered the public transport. This place has no air conditioner so it was very hot for a few days. Nice views and very quiet.

196410,22063582,2014-10-29,380770,Thomas,"The quiet and privacy I experienced during my one week stay at the Sweet Little Apt. were much appreciated. Other advantages were the close proximity to a fine neighborhood  cafe, produce store and gormet eatery. In addition Sunset blvd with its many restaurants and stores are within an easy walking distance as is the park and library. Though the apt. was fully equiped and well cared for Phoebe was in early contact to make sure all was in good order and to answer questions about the apt. and the neighborhood."

196410,31049253,2015-05-01,3172191,Sophie,Pheobe was the most wonderful host. Very quick to respond and everything stated on the apartment description was spot on...if not better. Her style and taste of decor is devine and I would happily stay here again. I also cannot speak more highly of how comfortable the bed was! Location wise it was easy to park next to a terrific coffee shop and lots of very groovy echo park bars and music venues. All in all I had a brilliant time and Pheobes hospitality made my stay even better.

I stayed for a week while in town for work, and it was one of the nicest airbnb places I've rented in LA. The bed is so comfortable, high quality linens and towels, all the necessary appliances to cook with--everything I needed was provided. The view was also great, and I could watch the fourth of July fireworks over downtown from the bedroom. It's not super private--other people in the building have to walk right by the bedroom--but at night the curtains block the windows so it's not a big issue. I would highly recommend to any traveler."

Comfortable room, full kitchen, bathtub and separate shower all combined to get me to suggest to my son that any future guests find out if this apartment is available.  Great coffee shop down the hill and around the next corner!! Great view of the city."

Phoebe is very proactive and responsive, and took a little emergency--my loss of keys--completely in stride. As a writer, I need to spend long hours at my desk at home, and the Little Villa turned out to be an ideal place to work in quiet during the day and to enjoy the cool of an LA evening. Street parking is straightforward and the location--bus lines are near and the freeway access quick and easy--is perfect for exploring LA in all directions."

196410,535546667,2019-09-24,6408460,Kailee,"Sophie's place is absolutely charming and it is evident that she takes a lot of pride in her space. Location was walkable to anything I needed- coffee, shopping, groceries, pharmacy, sights, etc. Couldn't have asked for a better location, really. Cozy and clean and felt like a home away from home! I hope to stay again someday."
196410,639233796255480560,2022-05-31,7655077,Thibaut,"The unit has a lot of charm and the view from the terrace is stunning. The location is exceptional, only steps away from Sunset Blvd, Elysian Park, or cute shops just down the street - making it ideal for anyone looking for a walkable neighbourhood. Sophie was always very responsive to my questions, communication was clear and easy! I very much enjoyed my stay there and will definitely return again."
196410,701480924998129419,2022-08-25,230830195,Marisa,"Beautiful apartment in a great location. This building is so lovely and has a rlly cool balcony/view. A lot of cool restaurants, bars, and stores in walking distance."
61578,108641533,2016-10-16,32788605,Paul,"Stated simply, perfection! This residence is ideally situated on Abbot Kinney and everything you need or want is within walking distance. The location is perfect. Next, I must comment on the architecture and furnishings of this residence. It was clear to me that Michael (the owner and architect) spent a tremendous amount of time and energy thinking through every detail from a design, convenience and comfort perspective. His ingenious plan for this home also creates a sense of privacy and calm even with all of the doors and windows open. It was wonderful to spend time inside and feel like I was outdoors and then, when I needed to change or shower, feel perfectly secluded and private within his open floor plan. Perfection achieved. Finally, the comfortable, cozy, modern beds and other things that matter (many places to sit, great views, two private courtyard areas, a large private balcony overlooking Abbot Kinney (with an outdoor fireplace), a wonderful dining room table for a special dinner with close friends) were all, quite simply, perfect. This residence is a dream. Would I live there and be entirely satisfied? Yes. Would I stay again tonight? ABSOLUTELY! Honestly, it could not have been more perfect in any way. Wow!"
61578,126799124,2017-01-14,5530730,Thomas W.,The apartment is really nice. Super clean and new. The kitchen has everything you need and the Garage down the apartment is pleasantly. All in all...perfect.
61578,145308660,2017-04-17,52488175,Greg,Space A is a unique and brilliant place to stay. Right in the heart of Abbot Kinney and a beautiful contemporary designer apartment. Happy to recommend it to anyone travelling to LA.
61578,147023270,2017-04-24,42079323,Jennifer,"This is a beautifully and thoughtfully furnished home in a great location. Michael is clearly very particular about the items he has placed in the home. Heath Ceramics dishware, Tractor stools etc. Also, it's lovely be able to be inside and outside all within the footprint of the home. The location is terrific, with dozens of local shops and restaurants right outside the door. It's a little bit tricky to keep that metal countertop in the kitchen clean - it just want to be smear-y, but that's a teeny tiny complaint. Would definitely recommend this home to anyone who appreciates interesting architecture and furnishings with a pedigree."
61578,415067034,2019-02-21,32345159,Lindsey,"A great place! Beautifully designed with lots of light and internal courtyards. The location is right on Abbot Kinney but is private and quiet. The second bedroom is across from a little private terrace which makes it excellent for friends. The architecture is stunning, the kitchen a dream to work in, the plantings lovely and well-cared for, and has a serene rooftop terrace with outdoor fireplace. We had such a good visit, thanks Michael!"
61578,420449631,2019-03-06,76825485,Louise,"Michael was an amazing host and accommodated last minute requests. This place is so well thought of — it’s got good WiFi, lots of natural light and is just a real great space to be in on a short visit to LA. It’s right in the middle of Abbot Kinney, so the location is the best."
61578,430513591,2019-03-30,2788491,Dan,Apartment is beautiful and the location is great.  More stylish and less “cozy” than other options possibly.  Great for adults looking to be in the heart of Venice.
61578,524339590,2019-09-05,14456538,Sebastian,beautiful architectural apartment in a perfect location.
61578,530492989,2019-09-15,222093426,John,Stunning architecture fantastic location tasteful and comfortable furnishings. I’m returning soon with my wife
61578,536008434,2019-09-25,3041054,Vivek,"We had a really lovely time at this beautiful apartment.  It's extremely quiet despite being on Abbot Kinney, and is incredibly designed - the photos don't do it justice.  All of the touches are extremely thought out from the large to the small (Sferra sheets; All-Clad kitchenware), and Michael was extremely pleasant through the check in process (we didn't see him again after that, but we didn't need to - we were busy enjoying our stay)!"
61578,550960399,2019-10-19,994714,Brad,"Michael was great to work with and quick to respond to any requests. The place is great, in a perfect location, and worked well for our workshop."
61578,556884499,2019-10-30,1551035,Takanori,"This apartment is the perfect base for visitors to Venice and the west side of LA.  The design is immaculate, with a variety of distinct spaces providing for privacy.  The finishes are high quality:  Sferra linens, Heath ceramics (really gorgeous).  The location on Abbot Kinney couldn’t be better.  It’s near the Blue Bottle coffee outlet, and less than 10 minutes’ walk from Gjusta.  The terrace is a great evening spot.  As we review this place, we realized it ticks all the boxes. We’ll be back."
61578,454357243285986510,2021-09-18,4374361,Luci,This is a fantastic place and the host is very helpful.  The flat is very clean and extremely well appointed.  We were completely comfortable there on our long 30-night stay.  Everything has been thought through - from the linens to the furniture.  I would definitely recommend this place to friends.
61578,484841847818753537,2021-10-30,20828057,Maeve,Michael was an incredible host and his home was perfect. Highly recommend to anyone!! Perfect location and super comfy home. I really enjoyed my time and was sad to leave!!
61582,1066414,2012-04-01,876335,Justin,"We had a terrific experience staying with Robin! My girlfriend and I (and our dog) sub-letted Robin's entire home for 4 months while she was away in South America. For us, it was the perfect way to transition our new lives from Chicago into Los Angeles. The neighborhood is diverse, quiet, and conveniently located just off the highway. There are lots of breathtaking hiking trails nearby, and of course plenty of fun restaurants to try (many of the best ones were already recommended by Robin in advance). Robin was excellent with responding to questions and concerns and took care of everything immediately! From thousand of miles away! Her home is fantastic, with a very comfortable bed, insanely great water pressure and heating, all tucked away in a very serene and, yes tranquil, environment. If you have Robin as your host, consider yourself lucky. They don't get more amenable, charming, responsive, and kind than Robin. We had a great stay."
6033,23470,2010-01-06,66709,Phoebe,"Sarah was a terrific hostess who could not have been more kind or helpful. The room, with ensuite bathroom, was large and clean and with fresh towels each day. A delicious breakfast brought to the room kick-started the day. The neighborhood was quiet and parking was very easy. Easy access to Malibu, Topanga, Ventura etc.  I would thoroughly recommend a stay with Sarah."
6033,69742,2010-07-27,25676,Jonathan,"It was pleasure to stay with Sarah. Her house is in a lovely quite neighborhood. Not far from Malibu, Santa Monica and LA. The room was spacious,comfortable and it had an en suite. Sarah is a great hostess. She cooked a tasty breakfast both mornings. We enjoyed staying with Sarah and we would highly recommend."

6033,14097566,2014-06-11,15620957,Henrik,"We stayed at Sarah house. She is a lovely host, really wants to do the best for you. Me and my girlfriend had a pleasent stay, we were lucky enough to meet both Sarah and her son. Both really good People! The area is quiet and parking is easy. I would recommend it and hope to keep in contact with Sarah :-) best regards Henrik and Sara."
6033,22960917,2014-11-18,20509694,Tara,Sarah was a great host. She was always quick to respond to my messages while booking and before arriving. She cleaned the space to be spotless for my arrival and was extremely welcoming and accommodating. It was a great area to have my own space with availability to also share in the kitchen and pool area during my stay. The location was also very quiet and safe as well as convenient to get to the freeway.
6033,23443654,2014-12-01,17985082,Nishigaki,"Sarah is a very relaxed and relaxing charming host, who is extremely friendly,  easy to talk to, easy to get along with.  I spent a peaceful week in her studio, enjoying the fireplace almost every evening.  I left the place filled with the sense of peace and serenity, already missing her hospitality.  I would love to stay again."
6033,25451950,2015-01-16,12357700,Spencer,Beautiful location and very gracious host!
6033,32403118,2015-05-17,5875833,Joahnna Lindsey,We had a nice stay at Sarah's studio... Our flight got in very late and we appreciated Sarah welcoming us and making sure we had everything we need. Too bad the weather didn't cooperate it would have been nice to have a little poolside hang out. :)
6033,35243317,2015-06-16,18159548,Antonia,"Sarah's home is beautiful and convenient to shopping and Route 101.  She accomodated us in another suite as this one became overbooked.  She greeted us and although she was abroad during most of our visit kept us informed and asked that we coordinate with other guests (she rents/airbnb several rooms/suites within the house) on some of the house details.  The other guests were amazing people from all over the world which really made our week a pleasant, interesting and fun time.  There is plenty of room and adequate privacy - it works.  I would stay again at Sarah's home."
6033,52431861,2015-10-29,29890685,Fiona,Sarah was a very welcoming host and it is exactly like the photos. I had my own privacy and the pool is gorgeous!
6033,53279358,2015-11-07,29331374,Casey,"Sarah was an excellent host. Waited for me the first day with a late arrival, and made sure I was comfortable. Bath and room were as presented. Everything was clean and in good shape."
6033,140777627,2017-03-31,70785841,Lauren,"Lovely host, bright and peaceful room, thank you x"
6033,199992188,2017-10-03,146682864,Kyle,Perfect stay and perfect location for me and my girlfriend to get away from the city without being far from the city
6033,220764404,2017-12-23,104496122,Anne,This was the best Airbnb experience yet. Sarah was great. The house was great. The location was great. The pictures were accurate. Will definitely stay there again. Highly recommend
6033,228064229,2018-01-17,164733571,Chelsea,Located just outside of the city and near all amenities. An easy drive into downtown LA. A beautiful Californian suburban residence with an amazing host. The house and backyard is absolutely stunning. Highly recommended!
6033,596112113,2020-01-21,15318601,Evelyn,Sarah has a wonderful house in a great neighborhood. The rooms are a good size.<br/>Pictures are accurate!<br/>One  thing you need to know is that the separate Suite  does not have a lock on the door and anyone can come in your room. Other  people were  staying in the house when I was there. I recommend that she add a lock  to make it a perfect stay!
6033,603931917,2020-02-09,102271786,Aleson,Everything was lovely I loved my stay
6033,620514885,2020-03-22,8379725,Ashley,Great location and spacious room.
6931,3197,2009-05-26,16167,A.,"Charles is a very friendly host, ready to help when you need a suggestion, and very quiet and respectful of your privacy when you need to be alone. The location of his apartment is great - a short walk from the Hollywood and Highland mall, and very close to all essential conveniences/amenities such as public transport, pharmacies, supermarkets etc.; the street itself is charming and quiet, though the house is steps from the busy and ever-interesting Sunset Boulevard."
61582,3993904,2013-04-02,2985175,Christine,"Robin's house was amazing! I lived there for five months, and wish I didn't have to leave. The house is small, but it has a great outdoor patio area and a separate converted garage studio, which really adds value. My pup and I had a great time here:) And Robin's neighbors are super! I couldn't have hoped for a more wonderful place to call home."
61582,12389618,2014-05-01,5309742,D,"I had a great experience staying at Robin's place. It is nice, in a quiet area. I made friends with neighbors. Love the neighborhood. Great eating places nearby, really recommend Auntie Em's Kitchen and the Corner Table. Macy's and Target shopping two miles away, Ralphs, Vons and Trader Joe's close by. Highly recommend."
61582,30918093,2015-04-29,774349,Leigh,"I can't say enough good things about my stay at Robin's place. The space, neighborhood, nature surrounding house, the hiking trail down the block, the sweet neighbors were an incredible welcome to LA. You can't go wrong with this amazing oasis."
6931,34840,2010-04-11,50687,Peggy,"A cute room with a nice balcony on a quiet street in a nice neighbourhood.  Charles was a great host, friendly and considerate.  Thanks!"
6931,38730,2010-04-29,53558,Martin,Charles was a great host 7 he knew all about Los Angeles. keep up the good work
6931,3112461,2012-12-18,2754827,Emily,"The listing is in a nice location, close to many of the hotspots of Hollywood (including the Walk of Fame on Hollywood Boulevard, the Chinese Theatre etc). Also, the subway connecting you to Downtown LA is within walking distance. There are plenty of places to eat in the area, including a Burger King, Wendy's, Subway, a few pizza parlors etc - plenty of options whatever you might prefer! The grocery store is also near. The gym has basic equipment enabling you do to a full body workout - and it's never crowded."
6931,12972884,2014-05-16,12584554,Stanislav,"Ladies and gentlemen! Let me introduce you to the best host in West Hollywood!<br/>Great room, outstanding view, absolute cleanliness and perfect location close to all possible transportations & stores. <br/>Charles was extremely helpful and always there to help about different issues — even not straightly connected to the stay. He is also very careful about your privacy.<br/>Strongly recommended!"
6931,13192631,2014-05-21,12371355,Kaio Douglas,"Charles is an exceptional host! He was very thoughtful in preparing everything for my stay. The place is amazing, could not think of a better place to stay in Los Angeles than Charles' house. Everything is clean, organized and comfortable. Even though I did not have a car while in LA, I could go to anywhere in the city by public transportation, as you are at walking distance to the Walk of Fame, from where you can take the metro or some bus lines. I had a really great time in LA, thank you Charles!"
61582,71874775,2016-04-29,2994686,Melissa,"Robin's house is magical! My husband and I spent 6 gorgeous months enjoying this treasure. The house has the perfect amount of space for a couple and the outdoor area was amazing. Great location with hiking trail at the end of the street and close to plenty of hip restaurants, yoga studios, etc. Lightening-fast wifi, comfy bed, awesome water pressure, washer/dryer - everything you could hope for! Highly recommended."
61582,147993881,2017-04-29,15339439,Vinnie,"We had a lovely time in this cozy, secluded cottage."
61582,445660590,2019-04-29,25045924,Molly,Robin’s home is beautiful and I really enjoyed a six month stay there. It’s on a great cul de sac with great neighbours and within walking distance of a couple of cute coffee shops and very convenient driving distance from places. Robin is super lovely and highly communicative. I’ll miss it!
61582,718918015,2020-12-27,5279503,Coleman,"Robin's place was great! It is located on a quiet street, with a beautiful patio, and had every kitchen tool I could need. Close to downtown LA and Glendale. Highly recommend"
61582,742744146,2021-03-27,42617882,Tyler,"Robin's place was wonderful. It was exactly as described and cozy for our needs. We loved the outdoor space and the neighbors were kind and friendly. Loved the local recommendations and often walked down to Lemon Poppy for a coffee and incredible pastries. There's also a cool plant store that opened up called The Juicy Leaf that's worth checking out. We loved outdoor, socially distanced drinks at Verdugo Bar, with a special shout-out to their regular food vendor 2Guys1Taco for making us feel right at home. It's worth checking out the walks through the neighborhood as well. We saw a few coyotes during our stay, which was cool from a distance, but would recommend folks be careful with their little pets! Elyria Canyon Park was excellent for dog-walking away from crowds as well. Overall, Robin and her team on the ground were responsive, communicative, and excellent hosts. Worth a visit!"
6931,16702621,2014-08-01,12850038,Lucas,"My stay with Charles absolutely exceeded any expectations what-so-ever! Charles is the friendliest and most adaptable guy I’ve met during my stay in Los Angeles. Considerate, caring and available are the three best words I can use to describe Charles as a person and as a host. I, without any hesitation, would recommend this place to any and everyone looking for a place to stay in the heart of Hollywood and Los Angeles."
6931,23354583,2014-11-30,1456707,Elizabeth,"I stayed with Charles for three months when I first came to LA. The location was super convenient for my studies, just a minute away from The American Academy of Dramatic Arts and very convenient for train stations, grocery stores and more. Staying so close really helped me to settle in and Charles' house was perfect for branching out to find new places to go to. I would definitely recommend Charles apartment for any students stufying near by who are looking for a base. The apartment was well kept and the bed comfy. Charles is very friendly and a good host. Thank you :)"
6931,32241401,2015-05-16,1236073,Rudolfs,Charles was the best host i've had on these Airbnb listings. Can't really beat that.
6931,32836092,2015-05-22,31435773,Kenny,"Charles and myself have a laugh everytime we see each other! Humble person and very funny! The area is very quiet and the transportation can be reach within 5-10minute! Hollywood walk of fame is a 10minute walk! You are pretty much surrounded everywhere! I stayed for 6 nights and the room... The bed is so comfy that everytime I come back from going out, I just pass out! Thank you for having me Charles!"
6931,271248096,2018-05-31,175283825,Joey,"I stayed with Chas for two months and he was terrific. The room is amazing, clean and so is the apartment overall. He was extremely helpful with anything I needed. At the month and a half mark I needed to extend to two months and he was more than happy to call Airbnb and work it out with me while also keeping the price from skyrocketing. He was respectful of privacy and was overall an awesome host. I 100% reccomend staying here, the apartments great, the location is perfect and Chas is a very nice guy!"
6931,433551884,2019-04-06,29245802,Ted,Stayed here for 2 months. Had my own private room. Charles was super friendly and was always attentive to my needs. The location is amazingly central. It was easy to get to a from the Airbnb. I definitely would stay here again!
6931,450227800,2019-05-08,68031652,Marcus,"Charles is a superhost for a reason. I stayed with him for an entire month as my transition back to LA and there was a never a moment where I did not feel welcome and at home. We had some excellent conversations and at the same time, Charles will respect your privacy as well. Everything is always clean and he is always looking for ways to make your stay better. The location also is fantastic as you not only have uber but are very close to multiple hubs for the electric scooters and bikes. Also, if you like to cook like me, Ralph’s is extremely close...even walking distance. It was such a pleasurable experience at Charles’ place and I would recommend anybody who needs a great place to stay (even if you will be gone most of the day) to book with Charles as you will not be disappointed!"
6931,461039473,2019-05-30,3992081,Maria,"Chas has a really clean little space with nice amenities for Hollywood, such as parking and nearby shopping.  He is a very thoughtful host, with everything very clean and ready for you when you arrive.   Check in was very smooth.  The one thing I have to mention is that for work travelers the internet is very slow, so much so that it will be hard to work if you are a software engineer.  It barely has enough bandwidth to stream a video.  So this place didn't work out for me given the internet situation.   The room is also quite small, so I would recommend this if you are planning on being out and touring a lot."
6931,474102167,2019-06-22,224210468,Dan,"Easy, simple and nice stay. Location is wonderful and the apartment is incredibly tidy. Would recommend to anyone"

6931,633850207,2020-07-01,301611732,Ritesh,"Sparkling clean place, quiet atmosphere, great amenities,  free parking, and a host that sincerely cares that you are enjoying your stay. The bed is comfortable, the shared bathroom is right next to the room, and the balcony with a beautiful view of hills is an added advantage. Location is close to major tourist spots, so if you are visiting LA for a vacation, this is definitely the place to be.<br/>Thank you Charles for making my month-long stay so comfortable. We had some interesting conversations(albeit shorts ones). This house will be my first choice next time I visit LA. Really a terrific host!!"
197756,594442,2011-10-03,1190405,Alyssa,"Came into LA for a long weekend and didn't want to stay at a hotel. Diana's lovely hillside apartment was the perfect location and had a real homey feel. The apartment was clean, colorful and accommodating. I especially loved the large shower! Will definitely be back to stay. This place has my highest recommendation and I hope more people can experience an easy and comfortable stay in LA!"
197756,901165,2012-02-04,181025,Bobby,"Diana's studio was great, clean, cozy, and great location near sunset junction.

197756,985689,2012-03-10,1787986,Jackie,My parents stayed here while they were visiting me and my family. They were very comfortable and enjoyed the space. The location was also great.
197756,1004044,2012-03-15,219869,Elizabeth,We loved this apartment. The location is phenomenal. The studio is comfortable and more than enough for 2 people. Diana's instructions on how to access the flat were exceptionally clear.
197756,1050513,2012-03-27,366263,Georgia,We really liked staying in Diane's cleverly designed and comfortable place.  Every convenience was provided and both beds were very comfortable.  The location in the hills is quite near sunset but it was so quiet for sleeping and then enjoying a moring coffee on the deck.  The neighborhood is lovely and convenient.  The gardens surrounding were very lush and reminded us we weren't in Canada anymore.  Thanks Diana.

197756,1266694,2012-05-12,1109340,Hugh,"The apartment is well arranged and includes everything one needs for a comfortable stay.  It is really pleasant to sit on the balcony for breakfast or just to read and enjoy the location.  The grounds are beautifully planted and well kept.  We would certainly stay there again when we visited Los Angeles.  Diana was really responsive to our needs, we really appreciated her attention!"
197756,1428196,2012-06-06,909098,Stefanie,"Great, roomy apartment with a very central location. Diana is a very friendly and accomodation host. The studio is clean and provides everything you could need. We were two people, but if the couch pulls out, four people can stay easily. I especially enjoyed the small deck with chairs and tables, to enjoy breakfast outside."

Best of all, the unit stayed cool all day!"

I loved being nestled in the hills of Silverlake, and I think the apartment is bigger than what you see on the images on airbnb. Thanks again for having me!"
197756,1871090,2012-08-02,963318,Jack,we stayed for 2 weeks and had a great time. excellent area - walking distance to good parts of sunset - and the place is spacious and comfortable
197756,2574049,2012-10-10,3550170,Charles,"Nice little spot tucked into a hill a few dozen stairsteps above Sunset.  Good kitchen, comfortable bed, very quiet, good wifi, not hot at night (the apartment is partially in the hillside, so it stays pretty cool).  We have lots of friends in Echo Park, Los Feliz, & Silver Lake, & this was a super convenient homebase for visiting them all & going to all the good restaurants & shops in the environs.  Relatively reliable street parking, though the spots were often ~1/2block-2blocks away (which is fine w/ us); also, it's important to note the street-cleaning days/hours, to avoid a ticket.  Nice big shower, plenty of towels (we have an infant, so we go through them quickly).  Never met Diana, but she was always very prompt, pleasant & informative over email, so that dimension was very nice.  Thanks!"

He's goes out of his way to ensure you have a pleasant stay.<br/>The apartment is large and stylish with a fabulous wrap-around balcony - many wasted hours out there in the sun!<br/>Jacuzzi is also a very relaxing plus.<br/>5 stars all the way. <br/>Would definately recommend.
61582,463085910096629202,2021-09-30,96957519,Aria,"Robin’s place was a dreamy welcome to LA ✨ my fiancé & I absolutely loved that there is so much nature not only around the house, but around the neighborhood as well. 15 minutes to downtown & 15 minutes to Pasadena, it’s really such an ideal location. The house cleaning service included is truly spectacular & something I appreciated so much!! Everything is stocked & there’s even a grill outside that we put to use very often 😋 the patio is perfect for working from home or even just hanging out, very relaxing & breezy. Robin was super helpful anytime we needed anything, too. Honestly couldn’t say enough good things about this place, we loved it all around!!"
61582,529837870421831198,2021-12-31,6989173,Alison,"Robin's place is exactly as pictured and as described (probably the cutest house in the history of houses).  The water pressure is great, the kitchen is stocked with every utensil possible, and the washer dryer are of top quality, I loved all the settings they offered. This place has pretty much everything you could possibly need to make your visit to LA a success. And while ultimately this location did not work for me, Robin was willing to work with me on a solution. She truly does want you to be happy here."
61582,615300751239613618,2022-04-28,7300148,Kelsey,"I had a fantastic stay at the Tranquil Artist’s Retreat. The place is exactly as pictured, and was a very peaceful place to spend 3 months while I was in LA for work. Robin is a fantastic host, very quick with communication. She  made sure that I had everything I needed for a comfortable stay, and would resolve things promptly if any issue or question arose. I highly recommend a stay at Robin’s place!"

Everything is tidy and very convenient, and Chas was a fantastic and attentive host. He gives you your space but will happily answer any questions you have. The location was also super convenient for my first month in LA (without a car) to get around! Highly recommend!"
6931,715796669,2020-12-15,3166002,Danny,"This place is fantastic...it’s centrally located in the middle of Hollywood/West Hollywood. I was here during a stay-at-home order which made my trip interesting, but I walked everywhere and explored LA on foot. The apartment is close to Runyon Canyon which I walked most mornings and that was a highlight of my trip. Chas is lovely and very responsive, and the place is beyond spotless. It’s also wonderfully quiet, with a killer shower and a hot tub that I used most evenings and felt it was private as no one else was ever there. Anytime I did use an Uber it was a short distance and cheap. I went to Blackwood Coffee every morning for fantastic service and coffee. Also recommend Black Canvas...both within walking distance. I definitely recommend this place for anyone wanting a quiet, comfy room in a clean, well cared for apartment in a great location."

6931,566767727490788181,2022-02-20,222026524,Alex,"I stayed at this listing from 9/20/21 - 2/20/22 in a private room with a terrace.  Chas the host is very communicative and keeps his Air Bnb very clean.  He has gone above and beyond in keeping everything clean.  Chas cleans the common bathroom and living room on regular basis as well as the guest rooms.  The guest rooms are vacuumed once a week and the host informs you via Air bnb messager a few days ahead of time before he does the vacuuming.<br/>One of the best features of my room was the connecting terrace.  I have spent many a day on the lounge chair reading one of the leather bound novels in Chas's collection.  There is also a charcoal grill that I used a couple times and left a bag of charcoal and kindling under the grill for future guests to use.<br/>The stove top is also available to use if you cook as well as the toaster oven.  Just make sure to clean up after you are finished cooking and prepping food.  There are designated spots in the refrigerator and pantry that the host will assign for guests to put their food.<br/>A washer/dryer is available in a common laundry room in the building as well as a workout gym, which I used regularly.<br/>There are many stores, restaurants and bars within walking distance.  The Ralphs on La brea and Fountain is the easiest grocery store to get to.  Target and Best Buy on Santa Monica Bvld and La Brea are about 1/2 mile walk.  The Woods off of La Brea is a low key, chill neighborhood bar.<br/>I did not bring my car on this trip but got around just fine.  There are plenty of bus routes around and the closest Metro line is on Hollywood and Highland.<br/>The neighborhood is generally safe but due to the proximity of the 'strips' (ie: La Brea, Sunset Bvld, Hollywood Bvld), there are some sketchy spots (homeless encampments) which is the typical norm of living in a big city these days.  Always walk with a purpose and maintain situational awareness of surroundings especially at night.  I would typically walk on the more residential streets paralleling the aforementioned strips as they are quieter.  <br/>Overall, I enjoyed my stay at this Air Bnb and will definitely book again in the future if this room is available.  Thank you again Chas for being an awesome host!"
197756,4002646,2013-04-02,366263,Georgia,My husband and I have stayed at Diana's hillside apartment 3 times.  It is a well-designed and well equipped comfortable space.  The location is great--just above Sunset in Silver Lake--but still quiet and sitting on the deck looking over the lush garden is very private and peaceful.  Diane is a a great host.
197756,4286829,2013-04-24,4752366,Patrick,Diana was an easy and accommodating host. Her place is in a great location with access to a great neighborhood. My colleague said he'd definitely stay there again.

Diana was very swift in her responses, though I made a booking on a short notice basis. She met us upon arrival and gave us a tips what to do in LA with a four year old. House is in a beautiful garden and you have a terrace in your part. Good thing for us was free parking in the neighborhood. This was a very nice stay and if I come to LA again I will contact Diana."

I would stay again here in a heartbeat."

Diana was an extremely helpful and efficient host, quick to respond to questions and provide immediate solutions.  She very kindly gave us an extra hour to check out which really helped with our travel plans.  We'd love to stay there again."

You head out the gate and there is a huge staircase that goes all the way down to Sunset where all the cool stuff is. Very gracious host and there were no problems. Very clear and concise instructions. Highly recommended, especially if you have small children."
197756,8106341,2013-10-15,222014,Christen,"Lovely spot with lotsa of privacy. Particularly liked hanging on the deck and the smell of eucalyptus trees in the yard.

I had a very good experience and recommend this place."

Great neighborhood and lots to do down the stairs to Sunset blvd.  The place is comfortable and has lots of books and artwork. Kitchen has everything you need for cooking and the wifi worked great too. There is an outdoor deck that we watched the Moon eclipse from.

It is really close to a major street which make a lot of noise in the mornings but other than that, I had a great time during my stay. Charles is very communicative and helps you through everything. It is a very fair price for its location in Hollywood as well. I would not hesitate to book again! :)"

His place is very clean and tidy. The room comes with a walk-in closet and terrace, the bathroom is shared with one other guest, the kitchen by everyone.

197756,22706577,2014-11-12,2755674,Jackson,"This apartment is a beautiful artistic space with a gorgeous view of Silverlake from the private deck that comes with it. The location is perfect--you can walk down to Sunset to ample food and drink when you don't feel like driving, and there is plenty of parking on nearby streets. The house rules do seem a bit overbearing, though; perhaps the hosts have had a rough experience in the past with unscrupulous guests. We definitely recommend this spot."

The unit is lovely, albeit a tad small for 4 (for a couple or a couple with just one kid would be ideal). The checking in and out was very simple, and Diana allowed us to check out late when our movers got delayed. Our youngest son quickly made friends with the hosts' son and enjoyed the stay quite a bit. They also offered use of their jacuzzi which our son quickly took advantage of!"

<br/>The area is super nice,and parking was easier than we feared (we had two cars). Very close to Sunset Junction and lots of restaurants and shops.,,,,

<br/>On the amenities side,the WiFi is super fast,and overall for a short stay we had everything we needed. The only thing I'd mention is the fact that most closets were full of the hosts' things,so it was tricky to unpack. But I assume it would not be such a problem if you were on vacation since you'd have less stuff to begin with.,,

The area felt safe and it’s located in a good spot away from the hustle and bustle of LA but about a 15 minute drive from it! I will say this house has a decent amount of bugs but being located in the canyon and in a warm area it is bound to happen. And the place was clean due to the cleaning people every week so it wasn’t that. I should mention Robin was very gracious in letting me keep my dog here, even though my dog had a couple of accidents in the beginning. She also responded to issues in a timely manner and made sure things were fixed. She also was kind enough to let me switch my stay dates around. I overall really appreciated being able to stay here!"

<br/>Very nice stay,would stay again.,,,,

<br/>Note: The main bed is very soft,"the small bed (futon) is quite hard. (no complaints)\"",,,,
7992,49319508,2015-10-03,38158082,Kim,Tom and Heidi are the most accommodating and gracious people.  They were always concerned that we had everything we needed

Also with the help of Tom we managed to avoid major traffic most days.<br/>For us the guest house provided us with a lot more, it was a great location but teamed with the greatest hosts, it made for the best holiday!  Tom and Heidi made our stay that much more special, and we could not thank them more. They strive to make sure that their guests have an enjoyable and personalised stay and they definitely did  this for us. They managed to be helpful without being in anyway intrusive. If you are looking for a hassle free locations with the most helpful <br/> hosts STAY HERE!!!"
7992,53075167,2015-11-04,45366958,Omar,Tom is a great host!  I arrived later than I expected and Tom sent really specific directions on how to get in the house.  I had no problem getting in.
<br/>The house is great,even had an iron so I could prep my consulting shirts!,,,,
<br/>Best of all is the quiet neighborhood,and all the nice restaurants,,,,
<br/>in walking distance.  I walked to dinner each evening I was there. Awesome after driving around in traffic for work all day!,,,,,

197756,43430431,2015-08-19,21660495,Emily,Response time was quick. Very easy to work with. Guest was happy with the location.
197756,44993582,2015-08-30,3627104,Doria,"The Hillside Apartment is in an amazing location and has a lovely outdoor terrace with a pretty view. Artemis left clear instructions on how to get in and out and though we didn't chat much, she seemed lovely! It was the perfect place to stay for my work trip to LA, would love to stay there again. Highly recommended."
197756,45740760,2015-09-05,27188363,Sarah,"We had a wonderful time at Artemis' hillside apartment. The location has the best of both worlds: serene and remote feeling, but with direct stairway access to Sunset Blvd on a main drag in Silverlake. Artemis and her husband were incredibly accommodating and responsive throughout our stay. She arranged for early checkin to accommodate our flight schedule, and was super quick to assist when we briefly had difficulty with a sticky lock. The property is beautifully landscaped and quiet, and the apartment is clean and lovingly put together. Would happily book again!"
197756,47127906,2015-09-15,3603411,Leo,"Artemis' place was just like the listing, a quiet hilltop above silverlake."
<br/>A short stroll from Sunset,it was the perfect location for walking the neighbourhood.,,,,
<br/>Clean,simple,and with a balcony view of the city,"it was a comfortable and quiet place to spend two days in LA. \"",,
197756,49934390,2015-10-07,3940402,Rebecca,"I booked this place for myself and a friend (for a trip to LA for work) and ended up not being able to make it down to L.A. however my friend did stay there for the week without me. Although I didn't see the place myself, my friend and colleague said that Artemis was very accommodating and that the place was well-located and very nice."

197756,51081326,2015-10-17,46011059,Marian,"Gorgeous spot! Very peaceful. Apartment is in a lovely part of Silver Lake, high above Sunset Blvd with city steps to take you down. With all the great restaurants and cafes you could ever want. Really comfortable bed and great big shower. It was (unseasonably hot) so I didn't spend much time on the deck, maybe next time. It was clean and exactly as described. I only met Artemis once when I had difficulty with the tv remote and she came straight down to assist me. No difficulty parking."
"<br/>Definitely recommend!!\"",,,,,
197756,60235061,2016-01-20,1715879,Victoria,"The neighborhood is great, it's nice to have the option to walk in LA. The freedom of not always having to jump into a car in priceless. The only downsides is their dog,  her bark is a bit intimidating but you only encounter it briefly in during the day."
197756,61519650,2016-02-05,982002,Caroline,"We didn't feel very comfortable in this apt. It was quite noisy (loud music/TV and footfall from above - we could hear the dogs claws on the floor it was so badly soundproofed.) We couldn't get our son to sleep at night, or relax in bed as there was a TV blasting over our heads."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The instructions to guests don't really make you feel at ease during your stay - quite sternly telling you your deposit will be taken back if you don't strip the bed or leave a dirty dish in the sink.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>We also found the place quite dark and gloomy – it doesn't get much light. And the TV was ancient and impossible to watch on the other side of the room.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Plus sides are that it's at the top of Micheltorena steps which are fun. It is clean and the bed is comfortable,so if you're going to be out and about a lot all of the above might not matter to you. We were travelling with a 3 year old so spent evenings at home and could've done with a bit more peace and a decent TV.,,,,

197756,64735351,2016-03-06,61405542,Mayo,The place was as advertised. Only the outdoor space was not as cozy as I imagined it to be. Artemis was nice and very responsive.
197756,68024028,2016-04-01,35442464,Thomas,Artemis was very helpful and welcoming in getting us checked into the apartment. The instructions provided were very clear and made getting checked in very easy and smooth.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The apartment is small but very nice and comfortable,and in a fantastic location right next to Sunset Blvd. The addition of the fold-out sofa-bed was perfect as it meant that the 2 of us staying there each had our own bed.,,,,

197756,70750733,2016-04-20,5217084,Nathan,"This is a lovely apartment: well-equipped, beautifully situated off a staircase, and located a couple of minutes, by foot, from the Sunset Junction strip. The apartment is not sleek, but it is very comfortable; with two good-sized rooms flowing together, it feels ample for one or two people. The balcony gets direct sunlight in late morning and early afternoon. The hosts were pleasant and direct, and, although they live in the apartment above, they never seemed to hover. The dog does bark, as advertised, but only when you enter and exit the property, which is nicely fenced in and set off from the road."

He is a wonderful host!
7992,54893615,2015-11-25,47549201,Felicha,Tom went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and welcomed while respecting my privacy.  Once I arrived he contacted me and help me avoid the LA traffic as well as waited for me to make sure I arrived safely.  He also went above and beyond to accommodate my departure time. Tom was an awesome host that you should stay with.
7992,55102274,2015-11-28,1765211,Laurence,"My spouse and I very much enjoyed staying in Tom's studio in Atwater Village.  The accommodations exactly as advertised -- a spacious, clean freestanding studio with a large desk, sofa and double bed, a small dining table, and a corner kitchen and bath with toilet, sink shower.  Tom was very accommodating and easy to contact from the time we booked the unit until check out.  And the location is great -- 1/2 block to shops, coffee bars and eateries on Glendale Blvd.  We would stay there again."

Tom would check in often to see how everything was going or just to give me some fruit or something else really thoughtful. I would definitely stay there again or recommend it to any others. The place was comfortable with all of the essentials. They were right about the area too. Atwater Village is cool, with lots of great places to eat within a short walking distance."

He informed us of what's around the neighborhood to check out during our stay in LA and would check up on us through text from time to time to see if we needed anything or had any questions. We had stayed during July 4th, so he told us to not be alarmed that locals would be putting up fireworks. The place was full stocked of everything I could possibly think of needing and it was so close to a lot of the LA attractions so it made things super easy.

We didn't arrive to his place till 12:30am and it was very nice that he was still up to greet us and show us around. The space is a lot bigger then expected from the pictures so that was a pleasant surprise. Their neighborhood is close to almost everything, which made our time their very pleasant! We never drove more then 45 minutes to get anywhere (45 minutes to Santa Monica) which is great considering LA traffic.

Für die Ankunft war alles vorbereitet, sowohl der Einlass in unser vorübergehendes Zuhause, als auch die Parksituation erläutert. Wir haben uns sehr willkommen gefühlt und auch Tom's Frau war sehr nett und offen und hat sich gefreut mit uns Deutsch reden zu können. :-) Wenn wir wieder nach L.A. kommen gibt es für uns keine andere Adresse. Für vier Personen ist der Platz mehr als ausreichend, man hat seinen eigenen ungestörten Bereich mit allem was dazu gehört (eigenes Gebäude). Ein Highlight ist die Möglichkeit im Garten zu frühstücken. Tom hat auch sehr viel Infomaterial über L.A. und aktuelle Events, sowie einen Plan der Lokale in der Nachbarschaft. Zusammenfassend kann man sagen, dass sowohl Ausstattung, Komfort, wie auch Beratung besser sind als in den meisten Hotels. Wir vermissen das gemütliche Heim und seine netten Besitzer schon jetzt."

Artemis was great about responding to any questions I had and checking in. <br/>My only ‘complaint’ is having to put away the dirty linens and laundry and take out the trash, especially when you’re paying for a cleaning fee. This is something I’ve never had to do at any airbnb before. Not a huge deal, just doesn’t leave a nice taste in your mouth.  <br/>Otherwise an overall good stay."

197756,258839533,2018-04-29,113158995,Natasha,"Cute basement pied-a-terre. Nothing fancy, but clean and spacious enough. The location is great - a nice and residential area, but a long stairway (2 blocks worth) above Sunset leads up to the place, so cafes and restaurants are very easily accessible. It’s also possible to walk to via lovely residential streets, though it’s still up a hill."
197756,261656208,2018-05-06,52122337,Sean,"Artemis’ place is great for a stay in Silverlake; clean, adorable, conveniently located close to Sunset Boulevard. We had a great time and would recommend!"
197756,264452211,2018-05-13,11547240,Rachel,"We loved our stay here. It was so quiet and restful. The wonderful thing about Artemis’ place is that it’s close to all the best Silverlake restaurants, bars and boutiques, but up in a peaceful residential neighborhood. They have a lovely green garden and wonderful views. <br/>There are some stairs to walk down, but a very easy half a flight. Sassy their dog greeted us, but was silent the rest of our stay. <br/>Would love to stay again!"
197756,269651517,2018-05-27,170494293,Ryan,"Great location! Super close to so many cool places, but also very quiet and peaceful!"

197756,282240889,2018-06-26,87622814,Devrim,"Wow... This place was truly phenomenal. Excellent location at the top of a hill, right next to poetically beautiful city stairs, with great views, and it’s all green around you. The place is actually not a studio, it has one bedroom and one living room with a full kitchen and a huge balcony. It is furnished with real furniture, not IKEA ;) There is enough sun light in the place during the entire day. By the way, it is so easy to find street parking in the area if you have a car... I will recommend this place to my family and friends..."
197756,318482493,2018-09-03,3258928,Katie,"Great central location:) Easy walk to the Farmer’s Market, great restaurants & etc."
197756,344503154,2018-11-03,29235670,Jonathan,"Wonderful accommodations! Extremely attentive and communicative host [almost immediate responses] while still providing complete privacy. Great location in the heart of Silver Lake – convenient to Downtown, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Hollywood, etc. The little apartment is hip and completely self-contained. The wrap-around patio and outdoor areas provide lovely views of the east side hills."
197756,348668427,2018-11-14,366263,Georgia,We have stayed at Artemis’s place many times and choose it because of it’s location and it’s unique space.  It’s lovely hillside setting is convenient to so many good restaurants and interesting shops.  Twice a week there is even a farmer’s market nearby.<br/>The space itself is filled with clever design touches and is comfortable for both relaxing and sleeping.  The main living area is light filled and opens to a lovely small deck.<br/>Artemis is a very welcoming host and is quick to respond to any questions.
197756,401186299,2019-01-13,113560251,Tellier,"Artemis space was phenomenal. Exactly as listed and seen in pictures, best location and view in town, quiet evenings for rest, very clean and cozy space for your travels!"
197756,403792928,2019-01-21,1279868,Bo,"Artemis’ place is perfect for a stay in Silver Lake—it’s located in the quiet hills but only a few stair steps up from all the great food, shopping, and coffee Silver Lake has to offer. The apartment was generously sized, spotlessly clean and well equipped. Others have mentioned noise from upstairs, but we didn’t notice anything—if anything we were the loud ones as our 9-month old did what she could to keep everyone awake at night! We would definitely recommend Artemis’ place if you’re looking for a quiet and relaxing place in Silver Lake!"
197756,406486964,2019-01-29,270141,Nelson,"Great location, walking distance to the best that Silverlake and Echo Park have to offer. Was there for a work trip and it was a pleasure to work on the patio. I got in later than expected and Artemis put on the heater and lights prior to my arrival and communication was super fast and easy. The shower is super large. The guest house did get a bit chilly in the living room area but wasn’t a big deal. Since I was traveling, I didn’t bring any toiletries because I had been in a hotel the week prior so my only criticism is that the only soap provided was bar. So be sure to bring your own."
197756,410875648,2019-02-10,9620996,Sharon,Great Place. Great Hospitality.

This spot is a sparkling clean and easy space to be in with views for days.  There are so many awesome restaurants, coffee shops and such - you hardly need a car.  Thanks, guys!"
63416,186970,2011-02-22,46521,Caroline,Excellent host. Great house. Just do it!
63416,194292,2011-03-07,116174,Layo,"Vincenzo was one of the most generous and hospitable people I have stayed with in airbnb.  He made great efforts to make me feel comfortable, and shared with me his vast knowledge on the Hollywood and surrounding areas.  Vincenzo also provided excellent information on what to see in LA and where to go."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>  The room was very spacious with a comfortable bed,good WIFI,TV and entertainment system,and a magnificent view of Hollywood hills and the Hollywood sign.,,

<br/>  The location was very upscale and peaceful,and well-located for public transport,restaurants and clubs,with a bus service within a few minutes walk,and within easy walking distance to Hollywood/Vine Metro.,

<br/>I would recommend Vincenzo's place to anyone,as it felt like I was visiting a friend,as he included me in a lot of his social activities,"which gave me an \"\"insider's\"\" view on the Hollywood lifestyle.\"",,
63416,199258,2011-03-14,422600,Marg,"Don't hesitate to book your stay at 3 Degrees. Yes it is a wonderful location with access to everything you would want to do in Hollywood. It also has amazing views out to the city and a deck with twinkling lights where you can relax and enjoy the view. BUT the real reason to go is Vincenzo. He is an accommodating and gracious host who  makes you feel as if you are at home and yet still specially away. He has a wealth of information about Hollywood and the area and loves to share it so you end up finding out, and  doing things you never would have if you stayed elsewhere."
"<br/>We are a couple in our 60s- more used to the \"\"own place\"\" style of accommodation so this was a different style of travel for us.  It was wonderful so no matter your age or travel experience - visiting 3 degrees will be a good experience for you.",,,,,

63416,211763,2011-03-28,142263,Eric,Vincenzo was super accommodating & easy to work with.  The views from his place were great and he even left us some snacks :) The location is very convenient - quiet yet near everything. I'd stay there again any time.
63416,217381,2011-04-04,456602,Shelby,"\"Myself and 5 friends stayed at 3 Degrees this past weekend and had a blast.  Vincenzo was overwhelmingly accommodating and we spent hours in the kitchen discussing all the great restaurants, theaters, and things to do in LA.  We truly didn't want him to leave!  He gave us a thorough tour of the house and a quick \"\"how to\"\" on the electronics. He left towels"

63416,267137,2011-05-16,584981,Maria,"Vincenzo was very hospitable and very knowledgeable about what to do in LA.  The room was great with fantastic views of the LA skyline and the Hollywoood sign. As UK tourists, It was an ideal way to get to know the locals and gain some insight into the LA way of life."

7992,122474944,2016-12-23,87408696,Eric,"Very clean and cozy place,  perfect for a couple especially but also easily accessible for possibly a group of three.  There was a plethora of amenities and resources, and the host, Tom,  even included very interesting and helpful suggestions to further the experience, with informative knowledge on local spots and how to access them. Tom was very accommodating and welcoming,  and had strong communication and a great personality, which made our trip all the much more a warm experience. Parking was very accessible, and Tom was very flexible with working out times for specific needs. The kitchen, TV,  fast WiFi,  hot plate stove, toiletries/womanly products,  and heater were some of the big pluses that really helped us out. Overall a great value, even greater venue, and the best host you could hope for. Would definitely recommend, as well as stay here for future reservations/vacations/getaways."

The location is fantastic, it's literally a minutes walk to shops restaurants and a short drive to many great suburbs (Glendale and Silverlake just to name a few!). <br/>The accomodation was as described, my husband and I stayed for a month and felt right at home as we had everything we needed (tv, fridge, hot plates, etc). <br/>Tom was a fantastic host and provided us with lots of local tips and reccomendations. He was always reachable and got back to us immediately if we ever had any questions."
7992,132569507,2017-02-18,115450962,Adilet,"I would recommend to stop at Tom's place, because it is very close to Hollywood, Griffith Park and Universal. Apartment was clean and smelled good! Very safe area."

He knows LA very well and can help you whenever you want. He loves helping and has many tips to share. He was like a tour guide. He can show you so many things so you don't waste time. We will definitely recommend this host for any other friends and family. We shared so many good moments together. Obviously, he lets you your own privacy.

197756,422976017,2019-03-12,7289347,Sally,Artemis was an excellent host and was quick to respond to our questions. The apartment is in a great location on a quiet street. There's free street parking in the area but it can be a little hard to find. The self-checkin was convenient and straightforward as well.
197756,441350401,2019-04-21,112189620,Sara,"Wonderful stay. The location is walking distance to bars, restaurants, and coffee shops. Spotless interior with lovely decor. We enjoyed the luxurious down comforter, selection of art books, and quirky treehouse. If only we stayed for a few extra days just to enjoy the view and the fire pit outside. Thank you so much for accommodating us!"

The house is a short walk down the public stairs to all of the cafes, farmers market, etc on sunset. Its a great neighborhood to wander around in and easy to hop on the bus or get an uber to see the sights. Artemis is a great host too serving up tacos and bourbon on arrival. Damn!"
197756,449860811,2019-05-07,18795650,Andrew,This is a wonderful location and a very charming one-bedroom apartment with a cute little veranda that overlooks sunset boulevard and is just a stone’s throw from all the action. <br/>I didn’t see much of the hosts but Artemis was extremely attentive and helpful whenever I needed anything. I had a small mishap with the key (I lost it on my first night...) but she was very understanding about the situation and we found a solution very quickly. <br/>It’s a great spot in my favourite part of town so a big thumbs up from me.

7992,147252081,2017-04-25,120428450,BreAnn,"We stayed in Tom's bungalow about a week ago, and were honestly blown away by the experience. Everything was better than in the pictures, and anything we could think of needing was provided. The unit was equipped with so many amenities it would be hard to list them all. The bed was super comfy as well! Even the yard was decked out with pretty lights, a table with an umbrella, two lounge chairs, and seats from Dodger's stadium. The location was also wonderful. We were within walking distance of a bunch of really cool bars and restaurants, as well as a few places to pick up groceries and things like that. If you stay here, I'd recommend walking over to Tacos Villa Corona, which was INCREDIBLE, and has also been featured on a  few TV shows. Tom was incredibly helpful, and was always quick to respond when we needed anything. He provided guidebooks and great suggestions on what to do in the area. Honestly, this was an amazing experience, and I would love to come back next time we are out that way."

<br/>Estuve con 4 amigas en la casa de Vincenzo y simplemente fue lo mejor que pudimos hacer... preocupado por cada detalle,siempre dispuesto a ayudarnos en nuestra estadía,recomendándonos los mejores lugares y fechas para hacer nuestro trabajo sin perdida de tiempo.

You are sharing walls and outdoor space with the family upstairs and the neighbor in the other unit... but we never had major issues with noise or privacy. A very functional and extremely clean space. Thanks for hosting us!"
197756,624110014,2020-05-06,174944166,Rosie,"A beautiful, spacious, and cozy apartment with a great location. The stairs are an immediate right outside the gate and lead down to the center of Silverlake! The backyard is beautiful and sparkling lights come on every night. Thanks for everything!"
197756,631556247,2020-06-22,651195,Carole,Artemis' place was perfect - very comfortable and in beautiful surroundings. The host was very helpful and responded very quickly when we needed help with changing the arrival date. I would thoroughly recommend this stay to others
197756,647422203,2020-08-06,2606042,Mike,"Cozy little apartment in an unconventional structure in a great neighborhood. Secluded & relatively quiet, close to everything around Sunset Junction & Echo Park. Stayed there for a month & rarely saw the hosts or the renters (in a separate unit) but Artemis was quick to respond if I needed anything."
197756,670268005,2020-10-02,1240920,Lindsay,"Excellent location, close to everything one might need in Silver Lake. Diane and her husband are lovely."
197756,714959035,2020-12-12,4068161,Rachel,Artemis was so incredibly helpful with everything to do with our stay AND prompt with every response. The place is such a beautiful hillside retreat!
197756,729299173,2021-02-06,24399895,Minah,"The location is fantastic! Nestled in a cute and eclectic neighborhood, the airbnb is just a staircase down to some of the best restaurants, bars, coffee shops, and juiceries LA has to offer. The host Artemis was extremely responsive and helpful. My partner and I stayed there for about a month and it was an ample enough space for us to live and work comfortably during Covid. We were able to enjoy the sun and the gorgeous views of the city from the patio. It truly felt like home. <br/>One thing to be aware of: Be careful when you use the stove. The smoke detector in the room is extremely sensitive. After the alarm went off for about the second time, the host kindly informed us that it helps to turn the fan on and point it at the smoke detector whenever you are cooking. We did that and opened the front door to let the air out as an extra precaution, which seemed to do the trick. This was only a minor inconvenience in an otherwise stellar airbnb experience."
197756,744159004,2021-03-31,48034667,Jennifer,"I stayed at this quirky and comfortable space for over a month while looking for an apartment in LA. It had everything I needed and the location was excellent. It was a little less private than I had hoped but this wasn't a huge issue. The host was super responsive and helpful. Overall it was a good, functional option for a longer term stay in the area."
197756,761062958,2021-05-22,376440590,Max,We had a great stay. Perfect place for a couple. Great location. Enjoyed the outdoor space.

The area has many great restaurants and bars walking distance. Street parking was easy as well. I’d definitely stay again. Artemis is a helpful and responsive host."
197756,456558769170428996,2021-09-21,27137259,Lauren,"Prime location! Great bed, beautiful yard, in-unit w/d and all the other essentials I needed for a month-long stay. If you have no problem with encountering large dogs and normal amount of upstairs noise, then this could be a lovely temp home for you. <br/>Prompt communication with the host who can easily assist with any issues since the host family live on site (I got locked out day 1 lol thank god she’s around to let me in)."
197756,565353294907811198,2022-02-18,22890401,Robert,"Artemis's place was perfect for our stay in LA, and met and exceed our expectations based on the listing. It's a beautiful location, well located in Silverlake but slightly removed from the hustle of Sunset Blvd. Believe it or not, we were even able to do tons of walking to restaurants, shops, and parks in the area! Can't recommend it enough!"
7992,154245961,2017-05-23,2888312,Paul,"We loved staying at Tom and Heidi's place! The apartment was as described, very clean and comfortable and located in a great area. Most of all, Tom was an excellent host, super friendly, helpful and kind, we are so glad to have met him and his wife Heidi and will definitely stay here again! We felt so comfortable there. The neighborhood was awesome: lots of restaurants/cafes and close to freeways and other cool neighborhoods. Highly recommended!"
7992,156936008,2017-06-01,1470869,Stephanie,"I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Tom and his wife and staying in their studio apartment.  It had everything one needs for a comfortable stay: a spacious main room with separate bed area and place to hang and put away clothes, a good-sized modern bathroom with stall shower, a well-equipped kitchenette with microwave, hot plate, and table that seats two, a futon couch from which you can watch television, and a better desk than I’ve usually found at Airbnb rentals, where I was able to get work done.  It’s bright and breezy as a result of multiple windows.  Tom and his wife are excellent hosts who are thoughtful about what guests need – for example, chargers for both iPhones and Androids are plugged in and ready for you.  They’re quickly available to help out if you need them and give you privacy when you prefer.  I will definitely stay again when I visit this area and encourage others to stay here."
7992,157735649,2017-06-04,52015933,Robyn,Tom was so helpful and his place was so clean and cozy! We loved staying there and the location is perfect!
7992,161077286,2017-06-16,57069589,Erica,"We really enjoyed our stay at Tom's place.  It was convenient to many of the places we wanted to go: Dodger Stadium, Hollywood Bowl, and Universal Studios. Very easy to pick up someone from Burbank airport. Tom also suggested the Huntington Library in San Marino which wasn't far and was lovely to visit.  The air conditioner was great as we definitely needed it 2 of the days we were there.  Tom really tries to think of everything to make your stay comfortable and I'm sure if there is something you need that he doesn't have he would figure out how to accommodate you."
7992,164574329,2017-06-28,114132607,Nguyen,Tom's place is clean and quiet. The room is rather small for family. Thank you Tom for your support while we are there.
7992,175001537,2017-07-27,83528137,Ambika,This is so much cooler to rent than getting a motel room for the same price. Having your own space and privacy is wonderful. Really dug Tom's place!

The bungalow is clean, and everything we need was there. Tom and Heidi give us a lot of recommandations and informations to make our travel something unforgettable"
197756,609527999688721004,2022-04-20,18800747,Steve,"Artemis’s place is an absolutely perfect place for this neighborhood, with great access to Sunset Blvd and Silver Lake. Very Clean, comfortable and very well equipped for a long stay. Artemis is a fantastic host with perfect, timely communication and assistance. The check in was a breeze. I would recommend this property without hesitation, particularly for longer stays. Amazing value for money."

197756,781995770885623153,2022-12-14,297645161,Aaron,"I stayed here with my sister for 2 months. The place was good for remote work, there is a desk and light that makes video meetings easy. The apartment is very comfortable and has everything you need. <br/>The only issue we had was that it was difficult to get privacy. If you're staying solo or as a couple this wouldn't be an issue, but the bedroom sliding door doesn't block sound at all and the bathroom is only accessible through the bedroom. My sister slept on the sleeper sofa, which is really comfortable. But again it felt difficult to have privacy from one another.<br/>Artemis and her family are very nice, naturally we saw them quite a bit over two months. They respected our space, but were friendly and helpful. And the puppy Siku is very sweet and fun to have around. <br/>The location is great. Pretty easy to find parking. It is a little noisy due to the proximity to Sunset, but it's really nice being able to walk to everything."
197756,845767665945351144,2023-03-12,33509309,Walter,Lovely Airbnb in an amazing quiet spot. Artemis was a very communicative host throughout. Great two month stay!
197756,871865519585814589,2023-04-17,2948333,Patrick,"I stayed for a month as I was prepping a move back to LA. Perfectly located in Silver Lake and you can walk to a lot (provided you're okay doing some stairs and hills, but that's also the charm of the neighborhood). The hosts were very communicative and friendly. The apartment itself was great for me as a solo traveler and would be comfy for a couple as well. I'd recommend bringing some sandals or slippers to wear around inside as the concrete floor can be cool. The Internet's good for working remotely, and you can take your meetings from your own little patio! Parking was solid as far as Silver Lake goes. I'd occasionally have to circle the block (usually when coming home late), but always found a spot. Overall a really great stay. Would recommend!"
197756,1100212708159822880,2024-02-26,3054465,Laura,This is the second stay at Artemis's and it was a wonderful and welcoming as I remember. Beautiful place and Artemis is very responsive and thoughtful.
7992,194966451,2017-09-17,141924611,Sarah,"Location is great. It's in a nice neighborhood within close proximity to many places and attractions. Tom was a great host. He left us snacks and toiletries. He also offered us restaurant coupons and lots of suggestions for eating or activities.  The driveway is long and cars need to park one right after the other, so coordination is needed if you or the host need to go in or out. For this reason we parked on the street however we had no issues finding street parking. Just beware of street cleaning days and hours. I would definitely stay here again."
7992,195774347,2017-09-20,16190821,Adeana,"Great stay, great location, and a very helpful and friendly host! Would definitely stay here again :)"

7992,199726917,2017-10-02,141373942,Jose Pablo,"Tom and Heidi’s place is absolutely wonderful, its location makes it really easy to go around LA either by transit or car. The neighborhood it’s in is great, it’s very quiet and calm but there’s also an avenue close by with a lot of shops, restaurants and things to do.<br/>Everything is as described or pictured, both beds are really comfortable, the kitchen has everything you need and the bathroom is really spacious. Me and my friends just loved every single bit of it. <br/>I stayed with 3 more friends and the space was perfect for 4 people, with 2 beds 4 people could fit really well but in case anybody wants a separate bed there’s an inflatable mattress and sleeping bag to use as well.<br/>All in all, we had a fantastic time staying at Tom and Heidi’s place, we were blown away by their amazing hospitality and carefulness they’ve put into making their place as enjoyable, comfortable and accessible for travelers from around the world. We would definitely consider staying again with them in the future!"

7992,212620842,2017-11-18,127605756,KyoungSoo,Tom’s place was amazing. Mr. Tom and Mrs. Heidi have treated us like their family. I would never forget this memorable experience. We have been here for 45 days. I can’t believe how quickly time has passed. <br/>Anyway..Everything you need will be prepared and you will be happy to stay at this place. Location was perpect and Tom recommended many things to do and place to go. I love this place and I’ll come back again when I’ll visit to LA. <br/>45일간을 지내면서 너무 좋은 사람들과 좋은 추억을 만들었습니다. 말로는 표현 못 할 만큼 감동을 받았어요. 다시는 이렇게 좋은 사람들을 못 만날거 같습니다. 집안에 섬세한 부분까지 다 준비 되어 있었고 뭔가 더 해주고 싶어하는 진심을 보며 한국에서도 느끼지 못 할 정도의 정을 느꼈습니다. 진심으로 더 번창 하시길 바라는 마음에 이렇게 후기를 남겨요. 제가 할수 있는게 이거 밖에 없네요. 꼭 여기로 오세요. 한국으로 돌아 가실때 분명 따듯한 마음을 가지고 가시게 될겁니다.
7992,214105159,2017-11-24,8377736,Alexander,"Tom and Heidi are wonderful hosts. Tom is very helpful and he was always in touch. When we had some troubles Tom was very responsive and was ready to help anytime. Don't be shy to ask if you have some questions.<br/>The apartment is perfect for 2 people. It's very comfortable, clean and full of features that a very important for living such as kitchen and bathroom equipment, electric adapters, apple tv. There is a quit cute backyard with garden furniture where we had a breakfast every day with a look at citron trees, flowers and hummingbirds. Location is very comfortable - 10 min uber to main sights of Hollywood. Strongly recommended!"

Totally recomend people to stay here if they want to be close to the LA scene but still live in a friendly and cosy neighborhood."

The bungalow has everything you could ever need whether it be for a short trip or a long stay. Jeffery was a wonderful host. He was extremely accommodating and even would send me reminders to move my car on days there was street cleaning in order to avoid getting a ticket. I would definitely recommend staying here and will surely be back should I end up back in LA again!"
198613,1220279,2012-05-03,1475485,Philippe,"This is a fantastic place to stay. Great location... near Hollywood, West Hollywood, Beverly Hills, STudio City Century City, and the  Melrose area and even downtown where i worked. The place is  quiet, clean, safe,  renovated, cozy, spacious, lots of charm and  decorated beautifully with impeccable taste. There is also a sunny backyard with tables and chairs. Located near lots of great cafe's, restaurants, stylish stores-the Arclight Theaters, The Grove Shopping Center,  Century City Mall, Target, Best Buy, Trader Joes, Ralphs,  The Parks,  and Runyon Canyon. My mother came over from France to visit, and she loved the place too.  I would definitely recommend this place to others, and more than happy to come back. Jeffrey made an extra effort to make sure everything was perfect, and to my satisfaction, always giving advices on the best places to see, to shop or to eat. He even provided a air-bed, and extra bedding for my mother when she visited.  I couldn't imagine a better place to stay in LA!"

198613,2832295,2012-11-07,3920583,Richard,"My first experience with Airbnb was exactly what I had hoped. Staying in hotels was wearing on me and staying in this comfortable bungalow made me feel like I lived in WeHo rather than a visitor. The cottage had everything you could ask for; conveniently located in a nice quiet neighborhood, close to hip restaurants and where I needed to be. Ample living space, comfortable bed, living room with 2 couches, work table with WiFi etc. Jeffrey is a gracious host who meets you at the door (he only lives a few doors down) and keeps you updated to anything going on in the neighborhood (street cleaning/weather/hot spots etc.)"
<br/>There is a washer and dryer and Jeffrey keeps a supply of coffee and tea,soaps,iron & board,even shampoo etc. Although I didn't use the well equipped kitchen (I wasn't there long enough) I will when I have extended stays.,,
<br/>All in all a very pleasant experience - especially for my first attempt with Airbnb!,,,,,

Jeffrey was beyond hospitable and always there if you need anything from a maintenance request to a suggestion for a good place for dinner. Parking was never a problem and the location is amazing! Walking distance to restaurants, great shops, bars, Target, Best Buy and very close to downtown Hollywood attractions. <br/>I would highly recommend this bungalow and Jeffrey as a host!"

The house has beautiful views of the Hollywood Hills and downtown Los Angeles, and the location is perfect, close to downtown and to alot of tourist destinations - only minutes from Paramount, and Warner Bros., Hollywood and Vine, and even Dodgers Stadium if you like baseball, and not far from Six Flags.  Vincenzo is very warm and welcoming, and very knowledgeable about the area and sight-seeing. After we toured Paramount and Warner bros. studios, our kids wanted to see Fox Studios, which doesn't do tours - but Vincenzo went to the studio with us and got us in for a  \"\"back stage\"\" tour!

<br/>Vincenzo also makes you the best breakfast and coffee in the morning and you can choose between eating it in the roasting hot front terrace overlooking downtown (we loved that!) or the cooler and shaded back terrace.,,,,,
<br/>Vincenzo knows everything there is to know about LA,California,the States and anywhere else you want to go...just ask him and he will give you not just the best tips but also cultural background! AMAZING!,,,
<br/>The house is really fabulous,cosy and private with an impeccable view,the area has always been our favorite and now we just want to move there!! Location is perfect...near the freeway but in a very quiet road up the hollywood hills and easy to get to anywhere whether in town or outside.,,,
<br/>MOST DEFINITELY WE WILL COME BACK ALL THE TIME!,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>we miss you guys...,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>lots of love,,,,,
<br/>Ilaria and Theo,,,,,

Vincenzo and Robert made sure we had a great time, they gave us tips on what to do and how to move around LA. I highly recommend 3 Degrees for anybody wanting to visit LA."
63416,648938,2011-10-20,544675,Michael,"3 degrees is now my home away from home when I visit LA!  Vincenzo is a wonderful and friendly host.  Highly recommended. The photos are real and I really loved being able to open the doors from the bedroom to the front deck for the amazing views.  Loved the kitchen. At night it was peaceful and relaxing.  I found it easy to get to with public transport.  While the Burbank airport is closer, I took the Flyaway bus from LAX to Union Station and switched to the Red line subway to the Hollywood/Vine stop and took a 4 minute cab ride to the house.  Instead of the cab, you could take the DASH bus (Beachwood Canyon) uphill and it will drop you two minutes walking distance from house: http://www.ladottransit.com/dash/routes/beachwood/beachwood.php"
7992,225222670,2018-01-05,6660536,Mika (Mick),"Tom and his wife are *THE BEST* hosts in all of Los Angeles. The place is sparkling clean, filled to the brim with amenities, comfortable, cute, stylish, extremely accessible, quiet, and very close to all that LA has to offer. But the best part is the incredible hospitality of the hosts. They go above and beyond what you would ever expect of an Airbnb host and their quick responses, hospitality and friendliness is truly what makes this the best listing in LA. STAY HERE!"
7992,226458544,2018-01-10,17300820,Jennifer,My brother and I had a great stay! Great location. It's close to everything we wanted to see. Very clean and exactly as described. Tom was an amazing host! He went above and beyond to make sure our stay was perfect. We were always able to find free street parking in front of the house.
7992,227430826,2018-01-14,85347283,Jesse S,"This was my first experience with Air BnB, and I have to say, I was not disappointed in any way what-so-ever. Admittedly, I didn't really know what to expect from this experience after staying in so many hotels over the last 20 years, but this stay was SOOO much better than I could ever have expected from someone's private residence.<br/>Tom was completely accommodating, friendly, and made sure that everything was taken care. He was extremely prompt in terms of response time, and always made himself available when I had a question or concern. I cannot recommend him enough, and will probably be looking into staying at this property again when I return to LA in the future.<br/>Thank you so much Tom, for making my stay and my recording experience a total win. You rock!!!<br/>Jesse"
7992,230250608,2018-01-27,9986457,David,"Tom is a great communicator; very fast and easy. The location is perfect if you want to be in the center of everything in LA and travel from west to east, etc - from Griffith Park to the Getty, etc. <br/>The room was cozy with a good bed, and there were heaters provided (in winter). Also, they had plenty of water bottles and snacks set out for us. Very pleasant! And best of all, it was super quiet at night!"
7992,233042467,2018-02-07,138646227,Ifftikhar,"Tom was really great i checked in around 1am and he waited for us. Showed us around and was really nice. Place was great, clean and safe."
7992,238725638,2018-02-26,170677106,Jalilla,Tom’s place was great! We needed a place to stay for the night before moving into our apartment the next day. Because we spent the night out in Hollywood we didn’t get to his place to check in until a little before 2am. He was very accommodating and stayed up for us. Made sure we had a place to park and plenty of space heaters as it was very cold inside. Would definitely stay again!
7992,239673657,2018-03-02,145320927,Arthur,"Tom's place was better than expected, very close to a group of shops, cheap ubers to all the major attractions, plus amazing people you are willing to help you out with any problem what so ever! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a place in LA"

7992,244553566,2018-03-18,150194423,Luca,"Tom and Heidi were the best hosts. Didn’t get the chance to meet Tom in person, but communication with him was very fast and easy. Heidi was an absolute sweetheart, very hospitable and made us feel very welcome and at home.<br/>As for the space it was more than we could have asked for, they really put extra care and attention to detail that it made the stay even more enjoyable. Very clean, cute, and comfortable space. Will be booking here again no doubt 😊"

198613,318444248,2018-09-03,150511680,Diane,"Jeffrey’s place was wonderful and suited our needs perfectly.  We stayed for more than a month and were very comfortable here. We would recommend it to an individual or couple who was looking for a cozy and comfortable space. Jeffrey was always very responsive to any questions we had.  The home is charming and very clean, reflecting how much Jeffrey cares about his place and how well he keeps it up.  It was just like the pictures, nicely decorated, with plenty of space for our belongings, full kitchen, and complete laundry room. It is located in a great area, very close to restaurants and shopping, but quiet and relaxing. We didn’t have any trouble finding parking  on the street and Jeffrey made a parking permit available to us."
7992,257585050,2018-04-26,100809163,Sam,We had a wonderful time at Tom and Heidi’s place. They were very welcoming and made our stay so comfortable.

7992,266915246,2018-05-20,170500908,Catherine,"Tom is an awesome host! His hospitality exceeded our expectations, and he was always available. He provided some snacks and beverages and recommendations for restaurants in the area as well as attractions to visit. His place is in a good location close to all the attractions we visited. The bungalow is cool because the bed is very comfy, nice shower and kitchen, and there is a seating area outside to hang out. Highly recommend staying with Tom when you’re visiting LA."
7992,267805248,2018-05-22,102512139,Sushma,"Tom's place is very comfortable and very clean. You will have everything you needed, it feels like your home. Plenty of parking spaces on the street. Tom is very hospital and welcoming. The location is very convenient. I wish could give 10 stars for this place."
7992,270892441,2018-05-30,165516270,Alison,"The space is just how it's depicted in the pictures. The bathroom is a bit small but if it's only two people staying it's perfectly sized. I found the amenities in the kitchen to be very useful and the Apple TV was used everyday. The main bed is comfy as well as the futon. The space is quiet and the lights outside give a very warm vibe to the whole place. Overall, Tom is great and the space is great!"
7992,285821534,2018-07-04,66121981,Jeffrey,"Perfect location, close to everting in Los Angeles and amazing host."

7992,309759991,2018-08-18,730368,Sarah,"Tons place is in a great part of LA, there are shops and restaurants near by. We arrived and  both Tom and Heidi were there to greet us. We got to meet their adorable rescue dogs. The apartment was lovely and comfortable with lots of lovely touches like a bottle off California red wine, toiletries and coffee. Tom even helped me out a load of watching on! We used the place as a base for a few days exploring LA. I didn’t want to drive loads so left the car parked up and got Uber / Lyft everywhere. Only $10 into Hollywood and about the same to the Griffith Observatory. Fantastic stay, lovely place and lovely hosts. Couldn’t ask for more."
206662,780773,2011-12-12,1465676,Orlando,"Kevin is great Host, the apartment is clean and very comfortable and warm, the place is close to everything if you want make exercise you have a park to hiking very close. Kevin have a dog very lovely."

206662,932852,2012-02-20,1559443,Nadine,"I had a wonderful stay here and felt at home. Kevin is a great host and became a friend. He is helpful, generous and uncomplicated. The apartment is clean and beautiful. There is everything you need, a very comfortable bed, a complete kitchen, W-lan and a huge HD-TV."
<br/>If you like pets,you will love his cute little dog.,,,,
<br/>Hollywood Hills is a great place,neighbours are young,friendly and sporty. You can walk to Hollywood Boulevard and you can go by bus and metro everywhere,although renting a car would be better in L.A.,,
"<br/> \"",,,,,
206662,952313,2012-02-27,561530,Simone,"Kevin is a great, laid back host with a lot of knowledge about his neighborhood and LA in general.  The apartment is very comfortable and in a great location with so much to do within a 15 minute walk.  The room is relaxing and spacious with a large closet and comfy bed.  And Delilah, Kevin's blonde Dachshund, is absolutely adorable."
206662,987805,2012-03-11,1695108,Yvette,"I had a great stay with Kevin and Delilah (his miniature sausage dog), I felt really at home and enjoyed our little chats.  It's a big clean apartment with everything you need.  There's a lovely communal pool and hot tub too and it's a great location.  I'd definitely go back again!"
206662,998473,2012-03-14,1586718,Rachel,"We were very short with our decision of where to stay in and around LA. At 6 pm of the night we were looking we emailed Kevin to see if we could stay that evening. We also contacted 3 others. No one else got back to us in enough time for us to get a place that night except Kevin. In the end I wouldn't have changed it for anything. We loved his place, him and his dog Delilah. We were lucky enough to spend his birthday with him too. We had a great stay in Hollywood Hills, walking around late night looking at all of the mansions in the area. In review we would recommend Kevin and his apartment to anyone looking and we will always look him up when in the area. We will miss you Kevin."
206662,1176958,2012-04-25,1759885,Syreeta,"I was there in April great weather. But First of all Kevin is the nicest and hospitable host I have had. He was friendly and helpful with my questions and went out of his way to help in any way that he could. The house was clean and the dog was lovely and it was in the vin-city of things Hollywood. The price is right the host is great, I recommend you to stay there. Great value for money. Awesome guy!"
206662,1295696,2012-05-17,2175466,Mehdi,"Kevin is a really great host,very nice cool and calm just like his dog delilah (so cute) the apartment is clean and very comfortable the location is just amazing just few minutes from Hollywood Blvd. I recommend him to anyone."

The Place is in a great location and the parking was super easy and safe. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. Such a breeze."
206662,1606287,2012-07-01,1808934,Christoph,Kevin is a super host. The bed was super big and comfortable. This dog was very fun to. :) I highly recommend to stay there if you want to have an awesome and cheap place to stay in the heart of Hollywood
206662,2061728,2012-08-21,1128159,Manuel,"It was great to stay for a couple of nights with Kevin. He gave me everything I needed and was very kind. Unfortunately, I couldn't stay longer."
"<br/>Thanks Kevin!\"",,,,,
206662,2224378,2012-09-07,3166152,Henrik,I had an awesome time staying at Kevins place. Hes a very nice and helpful host. The neighbourhood is really cool and the apartment is perfect. I can only recommend staying here while in LA!
206662,2466977,2012-10-01,2809106,Blandy,"Kevin is very nice and the place is very comfortable. The place is spacious, and very well located, just 5 minutes walking to the Runyon Canyon Park, and to Hollywood Boulevard. You have everything you need very close to home ( supermarkets, nice stores, museums, nice coffees ). You can ask Kevin some advices if you need some, he would know how to help you, he's very helpful even if he works. There is a swimming pool and jacuzzi that you can use, it's very nice to release ! The WIFI is very good, there is TV, a large bathroom and everything you can need in a kitchen, or in a house in general... His dog, Delilah is so cute and very nice too ! I stayed at this place 23 days and I spent so much good time, awesome and unforgivable ! If you go to Los Angeles (Hollywood) and if this place is free, go there, I think it's the best one ! Thank you again for everything Kevin ! =)"
63416,775435,2011-12-10,670277,Rima,"Vini was amazing. I know many have said it before, but you have to experience being his guest to understand how welcoming and generous he is. We would've needed a month to get our bearings in LA if it was not for him. He showed us the city he loves and wants everyone to see how special it is. He's for real!"
<br/>His place is a true experience of LA's history. It sits on a hill facing downtown from one side and the famous Hollywood sign on the other. The unique view can be enjoyed from the terrace day and night.,,,,,
"<br/>Thank you Vini for making our stay exceptional.\"",,,,,
63416,838846,2012-01-04,1455500,Ryan,I rented out this house during New Years Eve and had an excellent experience.  Vincenzo's exactly the type of host that you look for when using aribnb to book your vacation.  He was gracious to loan out his entire house to me and friends for the whole weekend and provided us with treats and full use of all his amenities.
<br/>As far as the accommodations you always hear how its about location,location,location.  And this house couldn't be better,you're about a 5 min. drive off the 101 Freeway and Hollywood/Sunset Blvds.,,
<br/>There are also great views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA area.,,,,,
<br/>If you are coming to LA for vacation/first time visit then I would highly recommend this place.  Vincenzo's knowledge of the LA area is better than any tourist book or information you can find online.  I just wish I could have taken him up on a few more recommendations but I had prior arrangements.,,,,,
"<br/>\"",,,,,
63416,858820,2012-01-12,1558532,Peggy,"I recently stayed with Vincenzo Jan 6-11th, with my boyfriend and best friend.  I used to live in the Hollywood Hills, so I knew how amazing the view would be, but I didn't know exactly where Vini was located.  He is high up there!!! Therefore the view of the LA skyline was so much more than we had expected and we enjoyed it morning and night.  We couldn't have asked for a better host.  Vini was great, friendly, knowledgeable, and gave us free reign of his house.  We cooked breakfast and dinner, we watched movies, we entertained friends, and came and went as we pleased.  For those who don't know Hollywood very well, Vini has a lot of great insight into restaurants and shows and can get you a  hook up.  For those of you who already know your way around town, this location is prime and you will NOT regret staying in Bedroom 1 with the french doors opening onto the deck.  Simply amazing."
63416,948402,2012-02-26,1608835,Sebastian,The house: AMAZING!!
<br/>Bedroom #1: AMAZING!!,,,,,
<br/>Vincenzo: AMAZING!!,,,,,

<br/>We had only time for staying 1 night but we'll come back,"that's for sure!\"",,,,
63416,967465,2012-03-03,1575259,Isabelle,"Staying with Vincenzo is like visiting a very good friend. He is a wonderful host, very attentive and has an abundance of good tips on where to go and what to do. The view from his house is fantastic and it is in a very quiet area. This is the best place to stay when in LA. You won't find any better."
63416,979517,2012-03-07,1218440,Ryan,"VIncenzo is a great host. He seemed to know exactly what I needed. His house is in a really magical spot - it's up in the hills and up a few flights of stairs from the street, so it feels like it's so far away from all the grit of the city. The views are just amazing and in all directions. I just couldn't stop looking. So beautiful."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>It's still just a couple minutes into Hollywood and I was happy to be in between Silver Lake and West Hollywood so I could go out in both neighborhoods. Next time I'll hike up to the Hollywood sign,"which looks about like it's in the backyard\"",,,,

63416,1173656,2012-04-23,991898,Michael,"Vincenzo is an unbelievable host. Except that everything is exactly as on the photos and described, he will help you with whatever you can imagine. Tickets for shows, hints for the best places in L.A. One could not expect more."
<br/>But short,staying with Vincenzo is truly an amazing air bed and breakfast experience,except that the beds are wonderful and no air beds. We will come back for sure!,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Vincenzo ist ein unglaublicher Gastgeber. Es sieht alles tatsächlich so aus wie auf den Photos. Er hilft einem sogar vergünstigte Tickets für Shows zu bekommen,oder verrät seine Lieblingsplätze in L.A.,,,,
<br/>Kurz gesagt,"ein Aufenthalt bei Vincenzo ist wie zu Hause!\"",,,,
63416,1463020,2012-06-11,302214,Kristi,"I specifically booked with Vincenzo based on his reviews... not really believing that someone else goes to such levels of excellent service!  Was I ever pleasantly surprised!!!  As a host myself, with a very high level of standards for my guest services, he absolutely did not disappoint!  I arrived with my little dog, Molly and a few bags.  He met us at the base of the stairs, carried our bags up and absolutely welcomed us as if we were a relative!  He was a wealth of, not just local information but an array of information (and I live in L.A.)!!   Vincenzo was THE perfect host!  He is funny, enveloping and above and beyond accommodating!  Molly and 'Flash Gordan', Vincenzo's gorgeous turtle, were able to sun bathe together on his beautiful deck over-looking the city, whilst I worked on my computer/ read a book, sipped on a delightful glass of fresh pineapple juice and snacked on his array of delicacies!  If you are worried about a 'shared space', leave those concerns behind!  I stayed for multiple nights and not once did I see nor hear another guest!  His place is HUGE and the layout is spectacular!  After my stay at Vincenzo's, I will be stepping up my service, as a host!  Thank you, thank you, thank you Vincenzo for welcoming me and Molly into your fabulous home!  ~ Kristi and Molly, the Pug.  Los Angeles, California.  U.S.A."
7992,310592649,2018-08-19,28882511,Moani,"Place is exactly as pictured, however the entrance description was slightly misleading... he states that there is a bamboo gate, but it is a plain white fence you pull a string to open the gate door, then walk in straight and there is a separate in-law quarters to the left which is the place of stay. Has a nice breeze and is pretty cool, there is an ac unit and a slightly noisy ceiling fan. He provides a bunch of brochures for things to do and see also a handy map on the desk of restaurants and stores nearby the house. There were a bunch of good stores less than a quarter mile away like a Trader Joe’s, Starbucks, pubs, and a row of restaurants and coffee shops.  Also provides bikes for your use. He made the unit very Apple phone friendly with an Apple TV and has a couple iPhone chargers already plugged in for an Apple user’s convenience. He was very friendly and graciously offered to move our car into the driveway after he returned home since we were out. He has dogs but we did not hear them once, we only found out from the previous guests’ note. I would definitely stay again!"
7992,313600758,2018-08-25,67394289,Emily,"Tom and Heidi were wonderful, thoughtful hosts who were super responsive to all of our questions and needs! Our quick two-day stay in Los Angeles was perfectly spent at their home."

7992,317138119,2018-09-01,204308792,Robert,"I highly recommend this airbnb if you are staying in LA. Tom was eager to ensure that we were comfortable and had everything we needed and is very friendly. The location is perfect for exploration, LA is huge but this is in a nice neighborhood and fairly central to many tourist attractions. Also walkable to many good restaurants and stores. The privacy is excellent as you have a guest house which is basically a studio apartment. Also a nice patio and backyard area if you want to sit outside. Would stay here again if I'm in LA"
7992,318871839,2018-09-04,26810113,Christelle,"We really enjoyed our stay, everything was as described. We particularly appreciated that it was clean, quiet with many easily-accessible shops and restaurants (walking distance or with a car).

The bed is comfortable and easy to get in and out of, and there are lots of places to work and sit: a desk with a comfortable chair, a table to eat at, and futon couch.  The kitchen has a refrigerator and lots of small appliances.  The bathroom is comfortable and well appointed.  This is a back house set in a beautiful lighted garden.  Everything is flat, and there are no stairs.  Check in was easy.<br/>Best of all, Tom is a wonderful host, has lots of great suggestions, and is easy to get hold of.  I appreciated the outstanding communication.<br/>It  is located right off Glendale Blvd and near the freeway, and is convenient to everything.  Every store, restaurant, and convenience is within walking distance. It is also wonderfully quiet.   While they provide parking in the driveway, I did not need it as I was able to park in front of the house every night.<br/>This is an exceptional value, and I look forward to staying again."
7992,329789267,2018-09-29,134097684,Wilbert,Outstanding host. Alway takes care of you
7992,331137845,2018-10-01,79657659,Nicole,Very nice place. The beds were super comfortable. Tom responds very quickly & is very flexible!
7992,332193479,2018-10-04,53783389,Dorthy,"A friend and I stayed at this BnB during both of our first visits to Los Angeles, and we found it to be the perfect place to come back to after some very long days. The bungalow was very clean, cozy, and had everything a traveler could possibly need. It is situated in a quiet neighborhood, and is a relatively good location for tourists (not too far of a drive from downtown / Hollywood / Griffith Observatory etc.). <br/>We were out and about for much of our stay so we didn't see much of the hosts, but Tom made sure to stop by and say hello on our first night there. They were overall very welcoming and helped us to feel at home."
7992,332604567,2018-10-05,200427329,Jeanette,"One night amazing stay.  The place was easy to find, not too far off of the I-5 freeway.  Location was a nice neighborhood walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops.  We were able to park in a neighbor's driveway who happened to be out of town, but it looked as if parking would not be a problem on the street.   Instructions I received were simple to follow and the place was easy to find and access.  Tom's place was very clean, bed was comfortable, kitchen has everything you would need, and the shower and bathroom space were great.  The patio area was nice and there were snacks available in the room.  I wished we could have stayed longer, and I will absolutely look for Tom's place first when I am back in the area."

<br/>,,,,,
<br/>I stayed at Vincenzo's hollywood home for a small anniversary celebration with few friends. The house,atmosphere and scenery were a phenomenal combination,I never wanted to leave.,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/> Vincenzo is also by far the best host,one phone call away and kind to all your needs + wants! Very comfortable,beautiful home. Perfect for romantic getaway,families,small gathering/celebration.

Wir haben den Aufenthalt sehr genossen und können es mit gutem Gewissen weiter empfehlen. Das Haus liegt sehr ruhig mit tollem Blick auf das Hollywood-Zeichen, schöne Terasse zum frühstücken und Vincenzo ist unglaublich hilfsbereit:  hat uns Karten für Universal Studios besorgt, fürs Theater u.a.   Durch ihn haben wir Los Angelos in guter Erinnerung und kommen bestimmt irgendwann wieder."

<br/>nice place. for our point of view,the house is in a good place,not far from hollywood boulevard,not far from Universal studio,the 2 mains places we wanted to go in LA.,
<br/>Vince knows how to receive people. it was a pleasure to meet him.,,,,,
"<br/>Have a nice stay in his house !!\"",,,,,
63416,2127678,2012-08-28,2452668,Giorgio E Caterina,"Abbiamo avuto il piacere di stare da vincenzo solo una notte, ma non avessimo perso i soldi cancellando la prenotazione altrove, saremmo certamente rimasti piu' a lungo. Persona disponibilissima, gentile, pronto a dare consigli per luoghi da visitare e posti dove mangiare o dove divertirsi. La casa e' stupenda, con una vista meravigliosa sulle colline e sulla citta' di LA. Tutto pulitissimo. Colazione fantastica. Pensiamo che Vincenzo viva quest'esperienza come una missione: far sentire i propri ospiti come dei re. Un amico da rivedere assolutamente."
<br/>We had the pleasure to stay for only a night,but after meeting vincenzo and see his house we dreamed to stay more. Vincenzo is extremly kind,always available to give excellent advices about what to see,"where to eat and where have fun. The house is so beautiful with a unique view on holliwood hiils amd downtown. All was extremly cleaned. The breakfast was fantastic. We believe that for Vincenzo is a mission provide to the guests a real experience in LA. Vincenzo makes it feel like so good. Vincenzo is now a friend to see again\"",,

63416,2518071,2012-10-06,1795915,Richard,"An exceptional host, a beautiful view of the Hollywood hills and downtown Los Angeles skyline which is spectacular at night from the deck."
63416,2596141,2012-10-13,3520080,Mirtho,"Un hôte, un guide, un ami voici résumé en trois mots ce qui vous attend en venant chez Vincenzo."
<br/>En venant passer vos vacances à LA et être  hébergé par Vincenzo c'est comme venir passer ses vacances chez un bon ami ou dans sa famille.,,,,,
<br/>Hospitalité,il vous sera difficile de trouver mieux. Conseil,aucun guide ne vous fera partager son expérience de LA et ses environs,mieux que Vincenzo.,,
<br/>Un ami c'est ce que vous aurez en retour.,,,,,
<br/>Sinon la maison est tout simplement superbe si vous avez la chance comme nous de profiter de la chambre #1 avec sa terrasse et sa vue unique sur à la fois le Hollywood sign et les tours de downtown vous aurez 50% de votre séjour comblé. Le petit déjeuner,le stationnement gratuit,dans un quartier calme et sur sont les autres atouts de cet endroit.,,,
<br/>On pourrait s'étendre encore sur des lignes pour vous décrire notre expérience chez Vincenzo mais nous préférons vous laisser découvrir et vous faire votre propre expérience.,,,,,
<br/>Une chose est sûre c'est que si nous devons revenir à LA nous ferons tout pour être hébergé chez Vincenzo.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>A host,a guide,a friend. Here,summarized in three words,are what you can expect when coming to Vincenzos' place.,
<br/>To spend your holiday in LA,hosted by Vincenzo,is like spending your holidays with a good friend or family member.,,,
<br/>Hospitality,it will be hard to beat. Council,no guide will share his experience of LA and its surroundings better than Vincenzos' place.,,,
<br/>A friend is what you get in return.,,,,,
<br/>Otherwise the house is simply superb,especially if you are as lucky as we to enjoy Bedroom # 1 with its terrace and unique view of both the Hollywood Sign and the towers of Downtown. Half of the joy of your vacation is already satisfied just being here at this place! Breakfast,free and easy parking,in a quiet and safe neighbourg etc.,,
<br/>We could go on and on,line after line,to describe our experience with Vincenzo,but we prefer to let you discover it and make your own experience.,,
<br/>One thing is for sure,is that if we go back to LA,"we will do everything we can to be at Vincenzos' place.\"",,,
63416,2673331,2012-10-21,945240,Annetta,"My husband and I booked this room with Vincenzo for a whole week. It was our first visit to Los Angeles, and possibly our last vacation for some time. From the moment we arrived, we were impressed! We were welcomed by Vincenzo upon our arrival as if we were family. He was incredibly accommodating, offered advice and recommendations everyday, and was genuinely interested in our well being. The view is breathtaking, the room is very cozy, and Vincenzo's hospitality exceeds anyones expectations. His reviews may sound too good to be true, but we can confirm that they are 100% accurate! Our experience in Los Angeles was amazing, and a big part of it because of Vincenzo. We recomend him to everyone :)"
63416,2890492,2012-11-15,3958182,Steven,"It was, befitting the location, an all star experience.  I have never in my travel experience been the recipient of such complete and gracious care.  The location is extraordinary and I have been to LA many times.  I particularly like the early sunrise that washes the deck just outside our bedroom; on your left is the iconic Hollywood sign and on your right is expansive views of Hollywood and the towers of downtown in the distance.  In between is a rural country view that is special in that all the Hollywood sights are within walking distance.  My Thai wife said that the food in nearby Thai Town is the best she has had in the US and prices are extremely modest."
<br/>   Vincenzo is a treasure....he is helpful and courteous.  He works in the film industry and has encyclopedic knowledge of the history of the area and current things to see and do.  I was particularly impressed when I asked if he could buy something for us for breakfast,"he  baked fresh  chocolate croissants...wow.  If you are visiting the Hollywood area of LA...or just LA...do yourself a favor and stay with Vincenzo.\"",,,,
63416,2941144,2012-11-22,3828533,Jess,"A day at Casa Vincenzo is another day in paradise! A lovely and gracious  host, sweeping views, delicious European breakfasts, comfy home and bed. My stay here was like a stay with family. I highly recommend it!"
63416,3150408,2012-12-24,3369727,Geir Egil,"\"Vincenzo is a wonderful host. Very friendly and helpful. He certainly does everything to make sure your stay at his place is comfortable. I stayed in \"\"bedroom 1\"\" for five nights and enjoyed the amazing views in all directions. His place is so high up it is almost like floating above LA. During my stay I also benefitted from his fast wireless internet and the convenient washer/dryer possibilities. An excellent place to stay.\""
63416,3392926,2013-01-22,1411550,Megan,Vincent could not have done more for us. He looked after us like family.

<br/>The house is great-beautiful views of LA and Hollywood.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>We thoroughly recommend staying with him. \"",,,,,
63416,3415888,2013-01-26,4549631,Jessie,"Our family of three had a fantastic five day and four night stay in LA. Because we only needed two bedrooms, Viincenzo was in place during our visit, and he helped us immeasurably with logistics and strategies for dealing with traffic.  We were newcomers to LA, and no matter how much you read about how traffic will dictate your days, it's still hard to be prepared for the reality of dealing with six-packed-lanes-in-each-direction freeways, one after another, standing between you and your goals. We consulted Vincenzo about our daily itineraries, and he was super-generous with his good advice and deep knowledge of the area's attractions."
<br/>Apart from being a great concierge and ambassador for LA,Vincenzo is an interesting,interested,kind,and enthusiastic person,eager to please and ensure that our trip was as good as possible.  Though he was home virtually all the time we were in the house
<br/>His accommodations are comfortable,attractive,and in a picturesque setting,as the photos indicate.,,
<br/>We wouldn't hesitate to use Vincenzo's place in the future,"and we'd love to catch up with our new friend at the same time!\"",,,,
63416,3519111,2013-02-11,4886964,Lisa,我们在这里住了三天。这里是我们春节洛杉矶之行非常理想的住处。<br/>房子在一个清静又安全的社区，停车和出行都很方便，离好莱坞和环球影城很近。我们最喜欢在舒适的露台上晒太阳和眺望美景。房间布置优雅而设施齐备，我用洗衣机洗了衣服，女儿甚至还弹了主人的电钢琴。<br/>Vencenzo 热情风趣，为我们准备的早餐丰盛又美味，他还贴心地按我们的口味和时间调整了早餐。他帮我推荐了风味各异的餐馆和游玩的地方，并帮我打印优惠的影城门票。<br/>总之，很感激Vincenzo，还有Robert，离开的时候我感觉就像和老朋友告别。女儿也一直对这里念念不忘...... 非常美好的体验！
206662,2721892,2012-10-26,434624,Sher,"Kevin's place is very nice, spacious, and in the most ideal location if you want to hang out in the Hollywood area.  The guest bed is huge and very comfy.  He has the cutest and sweetest dog who will be a great friend while you are visiting:)"
206662,2756314,2012-10-29,1113256,Peter,Kevin is great! He has a conveniently located home in a great area which is extremely secure. The best was extremely comfortable and the place is clean. Definitely would stay there again!
206662,3050311,2012-12-09,2663884,Justin,"I'm delighted. Kevin's was the first space that I've rented from Airbnb and it was exactly what I was looking for: comfortable quarters, a hospitable atmosphere, and an excellent location. (And the wiener dog was a bonus.) I would rent from him again."
206662,3258241,2013-01-03,2618767,Josh,"Awesome place to stay if you are visiting L.A. and want an affordable place to say right in the middle of the action. Kevin's place just can't be beat for the price and location. You will be staying just a block north of Hollywood Boulevard and only a few blocks west of the heart of Hollywood's famous landmarks, shops, restaurants and theaters. If you want to get away from the bright lights of the big city, you can walk a block north and you are at Runyon Canyon Park for an easy hike to the best views of the city."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The queen sized bed is comfortable in the climate controlled modern apartment and Kevin's dog is a friendly canine companion.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>If you don't have a car and want to explore the city,there are buses that stop frequently on Hollywood and La Brea and the Hollywood-Highland Red Line subway stop is only a few blocks away,"about a 10 minute walk. Metro can take you anywhere you need to go in Los Angeles!\"",,,
206662,3406582,2013-01-24,468630,Jacob,"Excellent place to stay, everything just as good at Kevin describes it. Kevin is a helpful, relaxed & fun guy. I'd definitely choose his place again."

206662,3767071,2013-03-12,5247709,Zoe,A nice apartment in a fantastic area. Kevin was friendly and helpful. I feel the very reasonable cost is reflected in the not very private sleeping area. Not at any time though did I feel uncomfortable in the apartment and the bed is super comfy. Thanks for the stay and if you go stay give Delilah a stroke from me!
206662,5644828,2013-07-09,5522222,Ting,"Kevin is very nice,  the apartment is clean, and the location and neighborhood is pretty good. I am able to visit many places in LA via Metro living here. Thanks for ur host.."

He is sweet, very caring host and I felt right at home as soon as I stepped into his house. Also, his dog is the cutest thing ever and I actually missed her when I had to leave. Please give her a rub for me Kevin!"

7992,337874002,2018-10-17,53059402,Alicia,"Tom and Heidi are the greatest hosts! I’ve never had a host that cared so much about their guests. The guesthouse is very very very clean, stoked with light snacks, WiFi, Apple TV, cable, and a DVD player! The room has amazing AC and the beds are great for the stay. We stayed three nights and felt like we were at home. Tom was very attentive to our needs and checked in with us daily to see if there was anything they could do to help our stay go smoother. There are so many great things about this place and the hosts that could be said but the greatest take away is; Tom and Heidi truly care about your vacation/work trip and will go above and beyond to make you feel like you’re staying with family. Such a great experience!"
7992,341386291,2018-10-26,23820053,Rebekah,"This adorable bungalow was outstanding! Everything we needed was there and I didn’t have one complaint! Tom was a wonderful host, the communication was great and I had no worries the entire time. I definitely recommend this place!"

I stayed for 3 days without any issues. Tom is so very helpful and accommodating. He recommended great eateries and was very helpful by having maps of the local area to show where good food and entertainment are. The only thing I would talk about be a challenge was the parking. The street is very narrow so parking could be an issue. Tom took care of that as well. He made sure that your car would be parked off the street if preferred and had the car pulled out ready to go when you needed it. So more a challenge for him if anything, but he was so eager to make sure your car was in a safe place. I pretty much left my car there and Ubered where i had to go. I will definitely be returning."
7992,345689156,2018-11-05,114069741,Victoria,Such a lovely stay! The area was nice and quiet and our hosts showed us nothing less than perfect hospitality.
7992,346434942,2018-11-08,82477352,Robert,"Tom and Heidi exceeded our expectations of what an Airbnb would offer, so glad we didn't stay in a hotel.  Tom seemed offer guidance at just the right moments without intruding on us ever.  We never had to worry about anything and when we did contact him with any question got immediate responses."
7992,349229565,2018-11-16,111745987,Steve,"This is a repeat visit for me because Tom is such a gracious host, this unit is clean, large, and comfortable, and the location is great - its in Atwater Village right off the 5 freeway.  One of the things that makes this space exceptional is that everything you could possibly neeed is provided.  Everythign is onthe same level - no steps and easier to maneuver in."

7992,353608772,2018-11-28,2491805,Jo,"Tom and Heidi gave us a much needed few days of rest at the end of our trip. The space was lovely and cosy, with comfortable beds, a great kitchenette, and our own well-stocked bathroom. The location was handy for everything we wanted to do in our last few days: visiting Descanso Gardens, exploring Burbank and Griffith Park, and a return trip to Universal Studios. A wonderful ice cream store, Wanderlust Creamery, is within walking distance and has some of the most bizarre and brilliant flavours...one of the flavours I tried was the Chicha Morada, which tasted heavenly. We had a couple of issues with the TV, but Tom was quick to respond to our questions and the issues seemed to sort themselves out in short order. We wish we’d had the chance to interact more with Tom and Heidi, as they are such lovely and warm people, and so helpful. Thank you so much for having us!"

206662,9435224,2013-12-28,314025,Young,Ideal place for folks looking for reasonable place to stay in LA.  Kevin is a great host and his apartment is on a quiet street within a few blocks of TCL Chinese Theatre.  It is a safe area of Hollywood.
206662,9767093,2014-01-08,935503,J.C.,"Los Angeles is huge, and living in Kevin's Hollywood apartment definitely made getting around a lot easier. It's located right next to the famed Hollywood Boulevard, with several Metro Rail stops along its stretch. Furthermore, there's regular bus service down the street that goes up and down the boulevard."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>I like living in Kevin's apartment,though I was out for most of the day and only returned to his home to sleep. Yet it provided for everything I needed: a cozy,quiet and clean space. Kevin also had the two cutest Dachshunds with him during my stay. They greeted me every morning and every time I returned to the apartment.,,,

"<br/>Kevin was a great host who readily answered all questions that I had. I would definitely recommend this place.\"",,,,,
206662,10052130,2014-01-27,11370034,M,"Kevin was a great host. This is my first time using airbnb and I'm glad that I had an awesome experience! Kevin was very social and the apartment was quiet, clean, and peaceful. The apartment is near everything in Hollywood and there's so much to do in his area. I would definitely recommend Kevin to anyone! 5stars!!"
206662,10208089,2014-02-06,10503011,Régis,Kevin a été très sympathique et plutôt de bon conseil. L'endroit est propre et bien situé. Nous n'avons pas eu l'occasion de beaucoup parler mais ce n'est que partie remise. Très bon choix pour qui a besoin d'être près de West Hollywood.
206662,10501061,2014-02-22,11993357,Philippe,"Kevin's place was great. He gave me a free upgrade to the private room because he had a friend staying in the main room and was very helpful when I started to struggle to find my next airbnb place. The location is walking distance to west hollywood, Runyon canyon and all the Hollywood sites... The dog is very cute although it took her a few days to like me. Two thumbs up!"
206662,10894595,2014-03-11,12233956,Jade,"Kevin was very friendly and told me everything about Hollywood including where have fun and meet people and recommended great places to eat. Kevin's apartment is great. I felt very safe walking around and its close to so many well know landmarks, including the famous walk of fame. I was able to come and go as I pleased and I got an upgrade to the bedroom which was awesome!"
206662,12934119,2014-05-14,10341417,Stella,"If you want to experience a real LA Hollywood ! It might be the best place for you with a reasonable price :) actually this is my first trip to US and i was alone but i adjusted to live LA very quickly because Kevin is really kind and he always try to help me to explore LA. During i stayed here  i could took a yoga class for free at the Runyon canyon( which is my fav place in LA, coz a lot of beauty and handsome ppls are there to exercise lol)  and i could go to good restaurants near from home :) and the area is really neat and safe and beautiful! And transportation was really nice even-though i had no car, I'm not familiar with LA.  <br/>Kevin and Delilah(cutest dog)is so nice !! Kevin is really honest and gentle man ! Whenever i need his help he just be there for me, and he took time for me to tour!!!! <br/>Because of him, i really enjoyed LA !!! I enjoyed the best vacation time ever in my life !!!  Don't hesitate 'just book here' <br/>I highly recommend you to stay here as long as you can !"
63416,3622254,2013-02-26,2665773,Bo,"This place was a single family detached home, not an apartment or not a condo. It was private, peaceful and most of all, the LA down town view was spectacular. The famous Hollywood sign is also very close to your sight. You can actually walk up to the Hollywood sign. Even though this Vincenzo's house is situated in a tranquil neighborhood, yet the location is superb, we were able to walk to Griffith Observatory, Vine/Hollywood sidewalk, Paramount, Koreatown, hiking trails to Hollywood sign ant etc. The kitchen & bathrooms were very clean and beds were really comfortable. The house has a large kitchen, so you can cook your own breakfast. It has washer & dryer too. Vincenzo is an extremely helpful, informative and friendly host."
63416,3775494,2013-03-13,1523086,Ramon & Kevin,Vicenzo has a friendly attitude and a charming personality that make him a wonderful host. He helped us to enjoy our visit. It was an unforgettable experience.
63416,3902399,2013-03-25,5580562,Sharon,"It has been a really pleasant stay in Vincenzo’s house. Overall the position is convenient for one with a car. And the house and the view around are fantastic. The indoor design is tasteful and comfortable with a touch of modern art. And it is well equipped with facilities for daily needs. The outdoor view is awesome. We can see both the HOLLYWOOD sign and the skyscrapers in downtown area. Various styles of houses scatter around the neighborhood. We made a nice adventure hanging around, such as seeing Marilyn Monroe’s first apartment building in LA. And we were glad to meet nice people while staying there. Vincenzo is really nice. He picked us up in the Chinese Theatre, for we lost our way (we don’t have a car), which we deeply appreciate. We also met other great people staying there. We loved to have interesting conversations with amazing William and hang out together to downtown. It was very kind of him for sending us to the union station when we went back. Thanks Vincenzo for offering us this wonderful experience. We did enjoy ourself during our stay."
63416,3992096,2013-04-01,3840982,Scott,"I had some friends coming into town and another host cancelled on the house we'd rented less than a week before. With less than 24 hours before their arrival, Vincenzo came through and saved the day. With very short notice, he provided us with his lovely home and was a very kind and gracious host."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>His house is precisely as advertised. Beautiful views of the Hollywood sign and all the way to Downtown LA. Three very comfortable bedrooms with cozy beds. It's a very peaceful and tranquil place. Perfect for having a morning coffee on the patio and listening to the birds. Or,in our case,"having some drinks with friends and watching the changing hues of the setting sun dance among the rolling Hollywood Hills. \"",,,
63416,4131995,2013-04-12,4528640,Steve,"I could not rate my experience staying at Vincenzo's place more highly. The guest room I stayed in was large, well-appointed and with a very comfortable bed. The house itself is very nice, and stylish in a comfortable and a relaxed way. One of the many benefits of staying with Vince is being in in one of the canyons of the Hollywood Hills. Contrary to what you might think, the hills are very quiet and relaxed, with an almost bohemian feel. This was true at least of Vince's neighborhood, where the nearby canyon road does not lead up over the hills into The Valley, meaning that it is not a thoroughfare unlike some of the other canyon roads. Vince's place has a stellar view of Los Angeles city in one direction, and the Hollywood sign/ the hills in the other. Every morning was accompanied by a delicious, fresh breakfast sitting outside enjoying the surroundings. It really felt quite luxuriousness."
<br/>Vince himself is a very nice bloke. He is welcoming,relaxed and friendly. He is a mine of information about Los Angeles,having lived there for some time and has lots of handy tips about places to go. Thanks Vince,you're the best! If I'm ever back in LA,"I know where I'll be staying.\"",
63416,4212974,2013-04-19,5249689,David,"I don't even know where to begin, and nothing i say will be enough to describe the amazing host that Vincenzo is, but i will try."

7992,403866007,2019-01-21,147927041,Kenny,"Tom and Heidi were super sweet. They were on top of everything during my stay. There is plenty of parking space (even pretty late in the afternoon) and the neighborhood is lovely. Their cottage is super chic. They make it very home like but modern as well. They offer snacks, water, coffee, tea as well as Apple TV and cable. Their outside area is sooo nice at night (i’m a sucker for lights) and they even offer bikes which is awesome! Very great experience and I definitely recommend it to anyone! 😊👍"
7992,404620099,2019-01-24,100559033,Jarrod,Tom's place is a great place to stay in LA. It's in a nice neighbourhood and is very quiet and private. We were very impressed by the little thoughtful touches and the place has everything you need for a short or long stay. We really enjoyed our stay in LA and would recommend to any future travellers.
7992,406244551,2019-01-28,128267099,Carrie,"This was a great space. It was a lot bigger than we expected   and three of us had a very comfortable stay. It has a great location and was tucked into the back of a fenced in yard in  a quiet residential area. It was a quick walk to coffee and food.  Tom was super communicative, accommodating, and a great host."

It was our first time visiting the city with the view of relocating, and Tom provided great hospitality as well as sound advice on the various areas of the city for ya to consider. He was also very accommodating in allowing us to drop off our belongings earlier so that we could venture out to view prospective homes. This was of great help since we had a short amount of time during this visit to explore the city.<br/>The home itself was very cozy, and Tom provided us with everything we needed to make our stay comfortable. <br/>It was a thoroughly lovely stay, and we would greatly recommend it!"
7992,409773799,2019-02-08,79413694,Karima,"The place is amazing, tucked away in a cozy neighborhood so the city sounds wont bother you at night, but close enough to tons of local hot spots and places to visit! The hosts are absolutely lovely and super helpful! Will definitely stay here again"

63416,4257428,2013-04-22,5821458,Vanessa & Marc,"Our first airbnb experience and it was perfect! A true vacation and Vincenzo is a perfect host. We arrived late but he still came out to meet us and help us up with our luggage. Even with our 2 dogs he was a gracious host. He had such a wealth of information on LA, tips, advice and anything else we needed. The room was large enough to fit a bed, desk, all our luggage and 2 dog crates with room to spare. No words could describe how happy we were with our stay and having Vincenzo there. We're already planning our trip back :)"
63416,4330565,2013-04-28,2293131,David,It's difficult to put into words just how awesome the view from Vincenzo's house actually is. Hollywood sign. Downtown LA. The canyons. Hummingbirds buzzing and tweeting in the bushes.
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>Equally difficult is describing how gracious and helpful Vincenzo is as a host. Never been made that welcome or comfortable in an airbnb rental before. Made me feel differently about LA at large.\"",,,,,
63416,4355720,2013-04-29,4729599,Ole Jochen,"\"we had such a \"\"bad\"\" experience with our previous host that we decided to spend the weekend close to Hollywood."
<br/>What a great decision!,,,,,
<br/>Vincenzo is a great (fantastic) host,caring about everything,gave us great advise,so friendly,and the location is perfect...we loved his house,the hosts
63416,4425736,2013-05-04,1470676,Salman,Vincenzo was a great host. His house is very clean and the room was in excellent condition.
<br/>He was very helpful about the area and things to do,"would defiantly come back and stay at his place in the future.\"",,,,
63416,4561380,2013-05-13,4821151,Anne,"This is the BEST place to stay in LA and Vince is a very accommodating host.  The room was very clean and beautifully decorated and you can actually see downtown LA and the Hollywood sign from your room.  I made arrangements with Vince to pick me up and take me back to the airport for a very reasonable fee (about the same cost as a taxi) which was very convenient.  The sightseeing commentary on the way was an absolute bonus.  Hollywood Boulevard, diners, restaurants and shops are within a short walk from the house.  It was easy to get around because the buses and train stops are also close by.  I won't be staying anywhere else when I come back to LA.  I can recommend this place to anyone travelling to LA."
63416,4647177,2013-05-18,5239890,Lori,Vincenzo is such a wonderful man and a tremendous host. The room was just perfect for our son. The views stunning.

206662,13146665,2014-05-20,13689592,Sunwoo,"I recommend you Kevin's apartment if you want to stay in LA with a reasonable price and a good location. It is close to Hollywood as he wrote. It takes about 10 min to go to Hollywood on foot. And his apartment is also very close to Runyon canyon(I've never been there, but I heard it from Kevin's former guest). His neighborhood is very quite and I felt safe. <br/>After I decided to go to LA, I planned most of it. Like where to go and where to eat, etc. I just went out in the morning and I came back late at night. So, in my case, I didn't ask him anything about LA, so he didn't tell me anything about LA. But if you want more information about LA, don't hesitate and just ask Kevin. He's a nice host so he'll tell you about LA. <br/>One of my good memories in LA is his dog, Deliah. I'll miss her so much. She is cute, smart, well-trained and super accommodating! I'm so sad she is sick, but I hope she'll get better soon!"
206662,13481712,2014-05-28,5337838,Britt,Staying with Kevin was great. Very neat and clean.  He literally stays around the corner from Hollywood blvd.
206662,13754853,2014-06-03,14868998,Crystal,"If you are seeking for a very comfortable and safe place in the center of Hollywood, Kevin 's apartment is definitely a good choice for your consideration.  It just two blocks about 5 mins walk to Hollywood blvd. And Kevin nice host who you can trust as well as ask anything about LA. That was great time for staying and i would like to highly recommend to all the folks of Airbnb."
206662,14156127,2014-06-13,1120245,Travis,"Kevin was an amazing host. He was kind, considerate, and accommodating. Kevin is also very personable. I chatted with him about work, game of thrones, and other such nonsense. =)<br/>I would definitely stay again with Kevin the next time I'm in LA. Thanks Kevin!"
206662,15550520,2014-07-11,37309617,Melody,"Place was very nice and clean, his dog was super cute. But be aware, you have to wake up by 10 am because he has to work at living room, also if you get hot easily at summer, he will try to save money from air conditioning. It was on but the temperature was a little high for me. As for the price and location, overall it was good."
206662,18071591,2014-08-21,9039667,Priscila,This was my first time using Airbnb and I had a great experience at Kevin's apartment. He's very nice and polite and his dog is adorable! The location is excellent!!! Very convenient for all the places I needed to go in L.A. Nothing really to complain about.

206662,19821938,2014-09-19,15125601,Josefine,"Staying with Kevin for nearly two weeks was my first airbnb experience - and it was a great one! He is a very nice and welcoming host and after a couple of days it already felt like coming home. His little dog Delilah is a pleasure to have around, too!"
<br/>Kevin lives right in the center of Hollywood,so if you're up to hiking in the Hollywood Hills,visiting the Walk of Fame or go to the Sunset Blvd then his appartment is the right choice. And even if you want to see other parts of the city this location is just fine: It takes just a couple of minutes to get to the next bus stop. If you need any advice concerning the best spots to visit,just ask Kevin,he seems to know everything :),

<br/>The apartment is perfectly located in walking distance to great areas,and only two blocks from the Runyon (GREAT morning hike!).,,,,

I expected that already, by reading the comments from previous people who were there, and also knowing that he's also a photographer and cinematographer, like myself, so we had things in common. As it was described, the neighbourhood was excellent and the apartment is really well located relating to sightseeing and public transportation. It's really easy to be at the heart of Hollywood by foot, and there are also some good grocerie stores, supermarkets and anything you need on a neighbourhood. It suited me very well."
206662,25366494,2015-01-13,20918289,Nicole,"Staying at Kevin's was such a wonderful experience! He couldn't have been a more accommodating host, making sure I had everything I needed and he was always so easy to contact (he had to go on a business trip). He even took time to show me around the premises and gave me great tips on where to catch great live music (Piano Bar!), good food and other essentials."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>His home is in such a perfect location and I was able to walk all along Hollywood and Sunset and take in all the sights. If you love walking around like I do,his place will be perfect for you.,,,,

He communicated very pro-actively and helped us get oriented in the neighborhood & in his home.

I would absolutely stay there again."
63416,5233194,2013-06-19,6281154,Ari,"Where to even begin! Vincenzo is one of the greatest, nicest people I have ever met! He is a great host and ensures you have a fantastic stay throughout. Vincenzo offers a ride and tour of LA from the airport for an extra fee but is totally worth it compared to what you will pay a taxi for!! I also opted for the breakfast and it is a great start to the day, eating and talking whilst surrounded by the Hollywood Hills and the views on offer are amazing."

<br/>Vincenzo connait tout sur le cinéma et ses voisins vedettes.  Il vous acceuille comme nul autre et vous loge dans une chambre ou rien ne manque; lit confortable,tv satellite,wifi,livres,...  C'est également un cuisinier qui vous prépare des déjeûners succulents qui vous dopent pour la longue journée qui vous attend.  Il connait les bons restaurants et connait les endroits à visiter en priorité si vous passez peu de temps à LA.,

<br/>L'endroit est très calme et le matin le déjeûner sur la terrasse se passe en compagnie des oiseaux,avec vue directe sur Hollywood d'une part et la ville d'autre part.,,,,

Tom’s is clean, fully stocked with all the things you need for your holiday from toilet rolls to sun chairs. It has great WiFi, bikes, tv and lots of little touches to help your trip go smoothly. We tried 3 restaurants Bon Vivant, a Vietnamese restaurant and a Mexican restaurant all within 5-6 mins walk from the home. All were lovely and offered great food and value. The ice cream place is a must too. Overall a great experience and 100% recommended."

The room had everything I needed and Kevin was pretty accommodating. The location is perfect. Smack dab in Hollywood, if that's what you're looking for. Parking isn't too bad, though it can get crowded if you're looking for a spot between 9 AM - 1 PM because a lot of people who hike at Runyon take all the spots. Just be REALLY careful reading the signs, or you'll get a ticket like I did."

Although it's a quiet street, the cinemas of Hollywood and restaurants of Melrose are within walking distance. The flat is extremely clean and Kevin is a very accomodating and easy-going person. Although separated by a huge room divider, the bed is in the living room, meaning privacy is limited, which is totally fine if one's out and about working in or exploring LA anyway."

7992,488871878,2019-07-15,34201479,Nathan,Tom and Heidi are great hosts and they have a great place. It’s a nice and private bungalow with all the necessities plus extras<br/>We especially appreciated the supplied usb cables for charging phones and the free snacks 😊
7992,490478278,2019-07-18,229913918,Caroline,Tom was great and the place was wonderful! They gave us great local tips and suggestions and were incredibly accommodating even when we came in late!
7992,491768363,2019-07-20,33720034,Eric,Studio indépendant bien situé et le plus Heidi parle français
7992,492784525,2019-07-21,239023164,Gemma,"We had a great experience staying here, plenty of small restaurants within walking distance. Very quiet and plenty of off street parking during the day! The bed was beyond comfy, hadn't had such a great sleep in a long time! Everything you could possibly need they have on stock for you. Tom and his wife were very hospitable and we look forward to staying in their home again when visiting the LA area."
7992,496673933,2019-07-27,138916064,英一(Eiichi),It was very comfortable！
7992,497674953,2019-07-28,196941493,Jill,"Great place close to what we came to do in the LA area. Not a far drive from Hollywood. It was clean and had everything we needed. It fit our family of 4 just fine for our 1 night stay. If staying for a longer length of time with 4 people it may be cramped if you each have luggage. We were able to park in the driveway, which we were extremely thankful for since the street parking is extremely cramped. We had a midsize car but a truck would be nearly impossible to back out of the driveway and would risk damage if parked on the street. Definitely reccomend this place if you are looking for a quick stay in the LA area."
7992,502572414,2019-08-04,218101114,Stephane,"Tom est un hôte très attentionné qui s'assure que notre séjour se déroule au mieux. Il avait même demandé à son voisin si nous pouvions nous garer dans son allée. <br/>L'appartement est indépendant, très propre, bien équipé et Tom et Heidi mettent beaucoup de chose à notre disposition (gel douche, shampoing, coton, sopalin, liquide vaisselle, bouteilles d'eau, laverie avec lessive...etc). Possibilité de manger sur la terrasse. <br/>La situation était idéale pour nous. 10-15min des studios Warner, de Griffith observatory, du départ du tree of life trail (rando derrière les lettres Hollywood) et à 2min à pied de Glendale boulevard sur lequel on trouve Starbucks et nombreux restaurants. Un peu loin de santa Monica et venice (45min - 1h15 en fonction des bouchons) mais impossible d'être près de tout à LA.<br/>Facile de se garer dans la rue également. <br/>Je recommande !"
7992,504471479,2019-08-07,166962680,Marc,This is a good value and great location for tourists in L.A.  Includes access to a laundry room which was a plus for our family.  Hosts were very accommodating and responsive.
7992,506579521,2019-08-10,94553271,Mercedes,"Location can’t be beat! Hospitality was excellent. Tom thought of everything with this suite; he had snacks, a microwave, refrigerator, 2 burner stove and cooking necessities, iron and ironing board, towels, comfortable beds, nice linens, great WiFi, cable TV, Apple TV, Netflix/WiFi TV, laundry, private bathroom, tourist maps, local recommendations, umbrellas, great ambiance... I could go on and on! The point is if you need Tom has thought of it! I wish definitely stay there again! I wouldn’t rent a car next time though because everything is so close and Lyft is so much easier!"

Their place is sparkling clean and well-situated - we were nervous to visit LA without renting a car but Ubers in their neighborhood were inexpensive and widely available. Heidi and Tom were so kind to us and full of great local reccommendations. When we visit LA again this will be a must stay for us. Thank you for making our first trip so special!"
7992,534537896,2019-09-22,35713332,Gina,Tom and Heidi were incredibly nice and friendly. We needed a place to drop off luggage off before heading to a wedding.

We visited with a toddler. We faced no problems during the stay. Tom was kind enough to even park my car in the driveway. There is ample parking space. Self check in is easy with very clear instructions. Both hosts are always available for any help u need. Overall it was a very pleasant experience."
7992,542761817,2019-10-06,54247626,Kevin,Absolutely would recommend! Stylish space in the heart of Glendale. Close to so many cool restaurants and attractions. Tom is an amazing host. We were attending a concert at the Hollywood Bowl and he gave us amazing advice on how to best get there and saved us a lot of time and money. The guesthouse was very clean and had everything you need to have a great and relaxing stay. Also the bed is super comfortable and makes for a great night's sleep after a day of adventuring. I cannot say enough good things about this place. Will definitely be back again!

The sitting area is very cozy and I loved having a spot outside to enjoy the weather without the crowds of LA. Tom & Heidi were very helpful and friendly. We appreciated the snacks they left! <br/>One note about the mattress for people who have bad backs-I was really stiff after two nights and it would have become painful if I had stayed longer. My daughter said the mattress was really comfortable and she was fine. I know I’m extra sensitive, but I always appreciate when people comment on the beds when I’m looking for places to stay."

They are well communicative and considerate hosts. The neighborhood is very charming and quiet. <br/>I had a date and was running late with damp hair, I forgot my blow dryer and I thought to myself I have much faith in Tom and Heidi there must be one here, lo and behold once I checked the bathroom drawer there was a blow dryer. Will stay here every time I’m in Los Angeles."

I'm so glad I did. It's 20 steps from the beach, cozy, and ideally locatated It's a little bit older of a building, but overall was perfect and just what I was looking for. I grew up near the beach and this felt like I was staying at my aunts house. There is a cozy living room area and a screen door on the front door, so on warmer days you can open the door and let the air in. The tub is nice and big, perfect for an evening soak. The back door in the bathroom also opens and creates an amazing breeze.  The neighbors in the other bungalows are full time residents and are so nice, they even invited me over to enjoy a little afternoon gathering with them. I will definitely be staying here again. Thomasina is one of the sweetest people I have ever talked to, she made sure I had everything I needed and was always available by phone or email. I feel so lucky to have chosen such a cozy home with a nice owner."

7992,542822750623264931,2022-01-18,188244864,Sim,This was a great spot to use as a home base for exploring Atwater Village. It's very close to lots of great coffee shops and restaurants and is central to the rest of LA.  The place itself was very clean and well appointed.  Tom was quick to respond to any questions and was very helpful.
7992,618876676605796747,2022-05-03,472077,Joan,"We so appreciated Toms helpful communication. He made sure checkin would be easy for us when we arrived later than planned , including numbers and even additional support through a friendly neighbor if we needed . Our stay was super comfortable and convenient - easy access to surrounding areas and all they offer , from here ( :"
7992,620331673631198641,2022-05-05,68579622,James,"I loved the guesthouse; it was the perfect space for me: spacious enough, comfortable bed and pillows, a good desk for working at my computer, free snacks, filtered water in the fridge, good cross-ventilation. Most importantly, Tom couldn't possibly have been a friendlier or more thoughtful host. He let me borrow a charger for my phone, which was a lifesaver, let me store some of my things at his house for a few hours after checkout time, and even gave me a basket of oranges from their tree."
7992,622541981945815981,2022-05-08,26380455,Samantha,"We had a great stay, and particularly loved the location for walkable shops and food. It was an easy drive into the city. We’re eager to return!"

Tom and Heidi are wonderful people and hosts who always had the kindness to chat with us, ask if we needed anything, and even offer us produce from the local farmers market.  The guest house is in the perfect location, and I was easily able to ride the bus downtown, check out the lovely neighborhood, and visit the beach.  They also have a beautiful backyard, which was great for reading a book and enjoying morning coffee.  I can't recommend this place enough and would love to stay here again!"
7992,884931655550706152,2023-05-05,19439020,Martin & Anabel,"Thanks Tom, thanks Heidi, it was great staying at your Airbnb. Your place is very comfortable and the location just unbeatable!"

"<br/>Pleasant housing and customized welcoming ..... it almost feels like home. Very nice Christmas decoration emphasizing the will of the mistress for a place of hospitality. Particular mention: some provisions allowing you to begin to sit quietly. Is also beautiful to have evening strolls along the canals in this period (Noell) - remains a highlight of this stay ..... to recommend without hesitation!!\"",,,,,
215161,848466,2012-01-07,1525575,Anita,"Upon arriving at Thomasina's place, I fell in love instantly.  At first I thought, perhaps too good to be true?  But as I found my way to the bungalow and opened the door, with each switch of a light, discovery of what was to be found once I entered the next room, I easily dropped both my bags and my jaw as I had come to realize this was going to be paradise.  Marina Del Rey is where I consider home, I pretty much know the area like the back of my hand and most certainly know which places I have come to find tucked away for only those privileged enough to live in them. Yet here I found myself in complete awe of not only the spectacular location (close to Washington Blvd. with all of the small good eats and a few bars, convenience stores, etc.), but the amazing ambiance, space, and layout of this bungalow."
<br/>I instantly texted Thomasina to let her know that if I could,I would rent the place from her immediately - that I was in heaven and she responded with the kindest of words letting me know that all I should do now is ENJOY ENJOY ENJOY!,,,,
<br/>Well,for what I wished to be a much longer period,I did just that- I relaxed on the patio that has a wonderful chimenea for burning real wood,was able to go straight to the beach to photograph and not miss one sunrise or sunset...and just enjoyed the wonderful little palace that had so much to offer.  Thomasina was always simply a text away and she didn't make me feel as if I were staying in her home,but instead that it was my home for the few days I spent there.  It is private,very comfortable both inside and out and recently redone with a special touch Toma must be blessed with
<br/>That on top of the fact that Thomasina had gone far FAR out of her way to accommodate me last minute was just the beginning. Upon entering the private nook of 4-5 bungalows,you can't help but notice how very nice and well kept it is. Toma's place is all you could ask for in a very cozy and amazingly well re-done space that makes you feel right at home. Her personality and warmth whether it be through her wonderful decorating of her bungalow or the combination of both that and her personality made me feel as if I were staying at a family members. I couldn't recommend this place more- it's the best. Thank you so very much Thomasina for doing everything you did to make it possible. I appreciate all of the effort you went to to make me feel at home and I will make sure to be in touch very soon! Best,"Anita! \"",,,
215161,987202,2012-03-11,137593,Julien,"The stay was great ! Thomasina answered all my questions very quickly and with care. The place is well situated and very very nice ! It was clean, confortable and with everything you need. I was more than happy to stay there and recomend the place to everyone. I will definitely stay there again if I go back in the area. Thanks Thomasina !"
215161,1014263,2012-03-18,1516904,Camille,Our bungalow was every bit as wonderful as previous reviews indicated!  It was roomy yet cozy with an unbeatable location.  The kitchen was huge and had the basic necessities to prepare a great meal.  Thomasina is a caring and conscientious hostess and we would be thrilled to stay here again.
215161,1040397,2012-03-25,1675634,Caitie,"Thomasina was amazing! She responded quickly whenever I needed something. The location was absolutely ideal. Everything was very clean and, I felt right at home as soon as I got there. It's close to everything you could need in the area including the ocean, wonderful restaurants, and shopping. I would absolutely stay there again in a heart beat!"
215161,1059527,2012-03-29,1961666,Dana,"We booked two nights at Marina Beach Bungalows as we had a stopover on our way to Hawaii for our honeymoon.  The bungalow was very clean and cozy and the kitchen would have been great to use but we mostly ate out.  It was in walking distance to some cute restaurants and shops, the canal(so nice to walk this before sundown) and Venice beach and pier. Although, we never met our host, she was so helpful and even left us a bottle of wine and tea light candles in the shape of a heart :)  It was a great place to come and relax after a busy day of seeing the sights in LA. We will recommend this place to others."
215161,1086765,2012-04-05,1841241,Janine,"Our stay in the bungalow was wonderful. There was plenty of space for all 3 of us, my husband, 8 month old son and me. The bed was very comfortable, perfect water pressure, plenty of cooking implements. The location is great, we walked along the boardwalk, through the canals and along Abbott Kinney. Parking was not too hard and we were there over the weekend. Thomasina was wonderful and very responsive. We will stay again!"
215161,1188726,2012-04-27,846196,Inga,This is my second time staying here! Perfect location for me and the place is cozy and private.<br/>Thomasina is helpful and communicative.
215161,1372901,2012-05-29,2138091,Ben,"This place is located, in my opinion in the best part of California and in the best part of Venice Beach. It is only 1 block off the beach, but because it is just far enough away from the ruckus that can be the boardwalk, it is actually very quiet and secluded. It also has a very nice high green wall of shrubbery which further buffers you from the street. When you're on the porch it feels like you are in a nice little garden, but with all the amenities of a city within a 2 minute walk."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The place is nice,it is exactly as shown in the pictures,a cottage on the beach,"and it has laundry..which is huge. We basically lived with the doors open (no bugs) and very safe area. Also the neighbors are really cool. This is a good place with a good value IMO and laid back in the style of Venice Beach.\"",,
215161,1402009,2012-06-02,257402,Tahria,Thomasina was wonderfully helpful as a host. I arranged for my parents to stay at the Marina Beach Bungalows as a stop on the way back home to Australia. Thomasina readily responded to all my questions and thoughtfully offered welcome gifts and assistance to my parents as they were arriving late in the night.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>My parents had a very comfortable stay,"conveniently located to the Venice Beach waterfront and with plenty of space for the two of them. I am now looking forward to the opportunity to stay there as well! \"",,,,
215161,1423805,2012-06-05,445931,Lauren,"Thomasina's bungalow in Marina Del Rey was exactly what we were hoping for when we planned a last-minute, nice, sunny weekend in L.A."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>She was always accessible via email and more than helpful when questions came up. The place itself is clean,comfortable,and sunny with bright colors; the bathroom was stocked with plenty of toiletries. Thomasina even provided the kitchen basics like coffee,tea,milk,some staple ingredients in case we wanted to cook and even a few beers in the fridge.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The location is superb - less than two blocks from the beach,within a few blocks of an avenue filled with restaurants and coffee shops,and walking distance to Venice Beach and Abbott Kinney Blvd if you feel like getting some exercise.,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>It was my first AirBnB experience so I wasn't sure what to expect and was a little nervous the place wouldn't be all it was cracked up to be,"but we were absolutely pleased and hope to visit again sometime soon. \"",,,,
215161,1454842,2012-06-11,1751780,Eric,Awesome place right on the beach! Walk 5 minutes and your right at the Venice Beach pier with food and shops all over the place. So much fun!
215161,1474181,2012-06-13,2338985,Kevin,"Great location, close to the beach and restaurants, but far enough away to be quiet in the evening. Thomasina was a great host, responded to email promptly, and checked to make sure our check-in went smoothly. My daughter thought this was much better than staying in a hotel."
<br/>The Cow's End,C&O Cucina,"and Lilly's should not be missed. \"",,,

215161,1682332,2012-07-11,2148598,Joey & Junior,The Marina Beach Bungalows was the most pleasant stay in our trip to the USA.  The bungalow was exactly how Thomasina described it - the images shown is just what you get.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>It was far enough away from the busy strip of Venice Beach to relax but close enough to go strolling around the neighbourhood.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Thomasina was prompt in responding to my queries - Junior & I will be going back there when we are back in LA.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>I highly recommend this to all.,,,,,

215161,1738627,2012-07-18,2324333,David,"We came out to L.A. for a wedding, but we wanted a better experience than a hotel can offer.  We've all been in a hotel, and it's pretty much the same thing every time.  Our stay at the Bungalow was unique.  It's an adorable space to stay in.  As we were traveling with our 10-month old daughter, we wanted a nice, but limited amount of space for her to crawl around and explore.  The bungalow was everything it was promised to be. We enjoyed the proximity to the beach, the quiet neighborhood, as well as the amenities the bungalow had to offer.  It was clean, well kept, and Thomasina made sure she was in touch with us and we could get in touch with her at any time throughout our stay."
215161,1876660,2012-08-03,412130,Andrew,"Thoma was easy, prompt and so welcoming to deal with! Her quaint Spanish beach villa was so close to everything . Very clean and inviting on arrival we felt safe and at ease at all times.  Definitely recommend, even thou it had no air con we had lovely breeze with the fan and beach air ! Thank you for a awesome stay! Jules & Ange"
215161,1903971,2012-08-06,1983472,Andrew,"was a great place - had a chill courtyard which was great to hang out in at the end of a day at the beach.  its about three blocks easy walk to the sand and waves and close to the action of marina del rey and venice but on a quiet street near the venice canals so quiet at night.  would definitely recommend staying here.  thomasina was a great, responsive host and the place was nice and clean when we arrived.  couldnt have asked for anything else!  great value place."
215161,1956502,2012-08-12,2697651,Tanya,"Lovely bungalow minutes from the beach! Communication with Thomasina (who is just lovely by the way) was super easy and the bungalow was spotless. Fabulous location, quiet, cosy and a great spot to base yourself from when visiting LA as it is away from the hustle and bustle of the city, yet within easy walking distance to restaurants/shops/margaritas! We had a wonderful sun soaked visit and even had dolphins swim right up to us at the beach! Highly recommended!"
215161,2018437,2012-08-18,2696264,Audrey,"Perfect stay in Marina del Rey ! But first of all, Thomasina was perfect : she answered to our questions as soon as we sent the e-mails ! She was very helpfull, nice, suggested stores around the corner... Her place was perfect too. The bungalow was very nice and cleen, the beach was closer than we thought. It was a really good surprise ! We really eanjoyed our stay ! Thanks again Thomasina."
215161,2044668,2012-08-20,968826,Megan,Thomasina is very helpful and friendly! We had a wonderful stay at her place. Very cute apartment and an awesome location!!! One block from the beach and a short walk to the vendors. It was actually really nice being at the South end of Venice because it was not as busy as it is where all the street vendors are set up. It was perfect! She made sure everything went smoothly for us and I would def recommend staying here! Neighbors are very friendly as well.
215161,2090524,2012-08-25,2971449,Terri,"The bugalow was truly comfortable and so conveniently located. The kitchen had everything you could need -- even condiments in the fridge and spices in the cupboard. The bed was lovely and there was tons of closet and drawer space. We spent a lot of time on the little veranda, and the neighbors were all respectful, the gardens were maintained, and the privacy was terrific (due to the thick hedge between the street and the property). Just a short walk to the beach and resturants. I walked, with my coffee, every morning along the canal trail (next to the bungalow) and visited with the ducks and other waterfowl. I've been going to the Venice area since 1978, and this was the best place I've stayed!"
215161,2108513,2012-08-27,1896303,Tania,"This was a great first time experience with Airbnb. Thomasina was very gracious, responded promptly and made sure my husband and I were very comfortable."

She made fantastic suggestions for restaurants, cafes and shopping spots. Thomasina is very generous person and fun to hang out with. We enjoyed our stay at the apartment which was very cosy and the interior design as shown on the pictures.We can recommend the aparment and Thomasina as host and in case we will visit Los Angeles again we would always stay at her apartment which is only one minute by foot to the beach. There are a lot of restaurants in walking distance. The apartment is located in a quiet street and the veranda was our favorite spot for breakfast!! Anja & Kati :o)))"

It was super easy to walk to the beach, pier, Venice area, places to eat, etc. I didn't need a car while staying here.  Thomasina was very friendly and a gracious host.  She checked in via text to make sure everything was great and left a bottle of wine on the table to add to the welcome home feel!  My only regret was that I didn't stay longer!"
215161,2745488,2012-10-29,3497823,Mike,Thomasina was a great host.... even though I did not meet her personally. She was always available for questions before and during our vacation.

The bungalow was walking and biking distance to everything, but super quiet. Loved being walking distance to the beach and canals.  The inside was cozy. Bed was comfortable. Lots of room for everything. Well equipped kitchen. Made use of the washer, dryer, TVs, dvd player, and all the cooking supplies. On-street parking was never an issue either. We always found a spot."

The small group of properties make for a wonderful little community and are kept private with fencing, lights and gorgeous lush plants.  The place had more than everything we needed and was a super close walk to both the beach and the little nearby town.  Thomasina was the most gracious host, making sure we had everything we needed and enhancing our stay with thoughtful gestures.  A great way to enjoy L.A with a host who truly cares about the quality of her guests stay...can't ask for more than that."

Much better than what pictures show, wide spaces, very clean and well decorated, outside deck including BBQ, excellent Service and communication with the host, and Location couldn't be better. This is 3 blocks from Washington Blvd, 2 short blocks from the Beach, very safe and calm location near all Venice Beach attractions on walking distance and minutes away to Santa Monica pier (very near grabbin a Bike). I can only say thank you for the great vacations we had, the quick and effective solutions for any questions we had on the house ( laundry, adapters for wall chargers, even AA Batteries for the ipod player). Just book this bungalow right ahead and enjoy!"
215161,5092253,2013-06-11,4417000,Madelon,"The appt was gorgeous and absolutely great location. Very nicely decorated. Thoma is very kind! Two things that were a bit disapointing. We got a parking ticket in front of the appt on the street as it was sweepung ticket. Of course our mistake, but perhaps it is a suggestion to warn people better. The other thing is that for this fairly high price it would be better if breakfast was included. The appt is very suitable for that. We found some old tea bags and that was it. Just some fruit, cereal and toast. Would make a great start of the day!"
215161,5298100,2013-06-23,905545,Marisa,"Thominasina and her place was very nice.  I was very happy here. Like others mentioned, the pictures don't do it justice. It is about a 2 minute walk from the beach!  The bathroom and shower are esp. nice.  There is TV and cable as well."
<br/>If you are worried about the area,I would not.  It is located in a nice,safe quiet area with a few nice eating places within walking distance.  It is about a 10 minute walk to the venice boardwalk area.,,,
<br/>Like the rest of LA,you will need a car to get around to other the areas,"but parking around the bungalow is not bad.\"",,,
215161,5412930,2013-06-29,1125042,Eric & Erica,"I hesitate to write this, because I want this place to be available next time we visit LA, but..."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>This is a great little place only two blocks from the beach and 3 blocks from Washington Blvd and its many food and drink options. Close to Venice Beach,without the disadvantages (trash,vagrants,drunk/high people loitering just outside your door,etc.) of being in Venice Beach proper. Fairly quiet street. I imagine parking could be a hassle,but we never had to park farther than 50 yards away with our small little rental car. 10-15 mins from LAX. Santa Monica is a 15-minute beach cruiser ride up the beach.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Breezy paradise. Nice little porch area; huge doors that can be left open in the living room. Really was super relaxing. No A/C (like many places around here),so sleeping with the windows open is often required.  If you require absolute silence,this might be a problem,but was not a problem for me (and I'm a light sleeper). The apartment door and porch are really close to other apartments,but all neighbors we encountered were friendly and quiet.,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Kitchen had everything we needed. Having a washer and dryer is a nice bonus. Host provides beach mats and chairs,so don't waste space in your luggage!,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Bottom line: this place is a GREAT choice for a single traveler or couple wanting to visit the Venice Beach area.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Thomasina was a fantastic host. She's sweet,fun,and full of energy. Upon arrival,we were met with a bottle of wine,lit candles and large bouquets of fresh flowers all over the apartment. How great is that?!  Communication with Thomasina was quick,responsive
215161,5568390,2013-07-06,7111522,Luke,"Wow! This place is a little hidden gem! Restaurants, Bars, Convenience stores and most importantly the beach were all within a block or two. I couldn't have asked for more gracious hosts in Thomasina and Steve either. They are incredibly generous and certainly made my stay feel like home. It was quiet, private, safe, and incredibly relaxing. I can't wait to go back!"
215161,5857424,2013-07-19,431794,Tim,"Thomasina's place was just perfect - cute, clean, and convenient.  It is one block from the beach, 1 mile walk to Venice, and 2 mile walk to Santa Monica, right along the iconic oceanfront walkway.  Check in/out were simple and Thomasina was fully available to help with any questions.  Highly recommend!"
215161,6129822,2013-07-31,777561,Joerg,"If you're looking for the perfect place in LA close to the beach, you found it! This apartment is clean, cozy and spacious. The perfect place for up to 2 people to enjoy and explore LA. I've been travelling to LA for business and leisure for more than 20 years and never felt so home away from home.<br/>Even though we didn't meet Thomasina in person, she was great in communication and was very responsive from booking through departure. We had an issue with the drains in the bathroom and send an email about it to her. Only one hour later the plumber showed up and fixed the problem. This was customer service at it's best!<br/>The apartment is fully equipped  with everything and we took advantage of the kitchen including coffee maker and the washer incl. dryer. There is a ton of nice restaurants in walking distance and more only 5-10 minutes drive away. Parking on the street is free and it was no problem to find a spot. Thomasina even pointed out that there is street cleaning in Mondays and Tuesdays and warned us to move the car in order to avoid a parking ticket. I never experienced such a caring host before. We'll  stay at Thomasina's place again, for sure! I can highly recommend this Airbnb rental!!!"
215161,6911869,2013-08-30,1427157,Brad,My parents stayed in Thomasina's beach bungalow apartment for three weeks.  They enjoyed the apartment and the proximity to both a beautiful beach and local shops and restaurants.  The apartment was clean and in order as advertised.  Thomasina was a gracious and accommodating host.
215161,7010879,2013-09-03,7110592,Matthew,"We stayed at the Marina Beach Bungalows on Labor Day weekend. I'm so glad we found this spot as opposed to staying in a hotel. The apartment is clean and spacious. Everything we needed was within reach. There's a full size kitchen with stove, microwave and fridge if you want to save money by dining in. Or you can simply walk just a couple of blocks to enjoy the eateries on Washington Blvd. We did both. The beach is only 1 1/2 blocks from the apartment. Parking is on the street. It was a little tough finding a parking spot at times but I'll chalk that up to a busy Labor  Day weekend full of beach goers.  Thomasina was very accommodating. We had a chance to meet her upon arrival. She gave us the 411 on all the good spots in the area. She also gave us the heads up on the parking restrictions on Mondays and Tuesdays. No worries! The restrictions didn't apply on Labor Day.  If you're tired of that same ol hotel, definitely come experience your home away from home at Marina Beach Bungalows!"

215161,7622029,2013-09-27,4849641,Lisa,Cute little bungalow in a great location. We loved being able to walk the Venice Canals and the beach was very close. I couldn't believe that there was free street parking right out front. Neighborhood was quiet when we were there and it was an easy place to wander from and explore the area. I'd definitely stay again if I'm in the area.
215161,7813998,2013-10-04,8649121,Peter,This was truly an exceptional experience.
<br/>Everything in this lovely apartment was prepared and kept beautifully.,,,,,
<br/>Thomasina made and kept personal contact during my stay and helped in the few small ways I needed..,,,,,

He recommended the great restraunt and share with us small tips for Disneyland. The apartment is quite clean and convenient. The amazing thing is that we don't need to lock the door when we are out.

63416,9617491,2014-01-03,10504407,Becky,Vicenzo and his place are amazing. It's really a package deal. My family and I had a wonderful time in his cozy home and enjoyed the spectacular view from his front porch. Vicenzo is so nice and accommodating he was available if we ever had any questions and he even came by to check on us when we didn't know how to start the dryer! I really wish we could have stayed longer.
63416,9776326,2014-01-09,10677123,Mark,"The property and views are nothing less than fantastic. Certainly a premier location if you're looking for a Hollywood experience. But even more incredible than the location was Vincenzo's hospitality. He was a wonderful host for our family, making perfect recommendations for restaurants and entertainment, and introducing us to hidden gems that would have otherwise gone undiscovered without him. Five stars can not say enough!"
63416,11181398,2014-03-24,7057598,Ryan,"Vincenzo's house is probably the best value you are going to find in Los Angeles. The views are astounding (Hollywood sign to your left, Griffith straight ahead, and skyline to your right). Vince is an incomparable host and is as accommodating as anyone could hope for. If you are staying in Los Angeles, there is no reason to waste your money on a hotel. Rent this place!"
63416,12927630,2014-05-14,14283880,Sienna,"If you're going to stay in LA, STAY HERE! From the sweeping views of the Hollywood sign, the city skyline and the canyons, to the impeccable cleanliness ofthis home, to the fabulous generosity and warmth of Vincenzo, you couldn't ask for a better place to make your home base."
<br/>Pros:,,,,,
<br/>- Vincenzo. He is super friendly,attentive to his guests' needs,and made me feel I credibly welcome and at home. He is one of those people whom you wish you could take home as your best friend. Having said that,he also knows when a guest wants to do their own thing. Vincenzo you are the epitome of class!,,
<br/>- Location. This house is located in a beautiful canyon in the Hollywood Hills,and is so easy to get to everywhere from. You feel like you're a thousand miles from the bustling streets,but are sooooo close. It's odd and wonderful!,,,
<br/>- The room. I stayed in the Avalon room,which is the largest. There are windows facing the canyon and hills,and a set of glass doors that take you right onto a most beautiful deck with sweeping views. The room itself has a queen sized bed,a TV,library of local resources,and is designed to feel like a home away from home.
<br/>- The home. Nicely decorated,clean,welcoming.,,,
<br/>- The property. Beautiful landscaping,very Californian.,,,,

Vincenzo was the most wonderful host ever, and he really made the place feels like home. He was so kind and helpful, and made sure we had a wonderful anniversary! He made us so sad that we only had a few days to spend in LA, and we can't wait to come back."
63416,14135518,2014-06-12,16321204,Julie,"Vincenzo是个很好的很热心的房东,在他家的院子里我们欣赏到了照片上的风景,我们坐在那里不想离开,住在那里得一晚,是我旅途中睡得最好的一晚,那里是那样的安静,空气是那样的清新.Vincenzo还为我们提供了咖啡，为我的女儿提供了果汁，他真的很友好，在我们即将离开时还热心的提醒我们路线的事情，要不我们就错过美丽的风景了，在这里我还是要在次对他表示感谢，谢谢你给我们留下了一个美好的回忆！希望有机会在相聚！"

Incredible! And I must ensure your upcoming guest, that this is not the only one considerable place he got. ;-) Next time I should do some less roadtrips and stay longer therefor. So that I could have some dinner with you and your guest , while in the background the Downtown is shimmering at night . ;)-) And yeah, I missed a fixed stay on my recently ended journey.. but hey.....

Die Unterkunft in den Hollywood Hills ist ruhig, wunderschön und der perfekte Ausgangspunkt, um sich einen Eindruck von LA zu verschaffen. Der Ausblick ist großartig."

Once we arrived we were created by Roman and since we did not book the entire place, were graced with his company for our one night stay. We were worried how a host would be with our sweet but active toddler or may be annoyed to have one around and like instantly our little guy and him were like best friends! It felt so nice to be welcomed into someone’s home like old time friends and I’ll take that experience any-day! Not to mention the views of the Hollywood sign  right above you on patio and the stunning city views both day and night. Although the home isn’t the hugest house In the hills, the charm and ambiance make it that much more grand.

A 10-minute walk from the Marriott, and two blocks from the beach and plenty of restaurants -- made it easy for me to attend a conference at the hotel and not have to rent a car, and be able to relax during my down time. The place itself is sweet, clean, spacious, and lots of little touches such as candles and sparkly lights to make it feel like an oasis. And Thomasina is one of the most attentive and conscientious hosts I've encountered. She was available by text for questions throughout my stay, had almond milk waiting in the fridge for me when I arrived (because I'd asked her if I could find it in walking distance for my morning tea!), and she even ran an umbrella over during an unexpected rainy day!

Steve greeted me warmly, and though she was out of town, Thomasina and kept in touch via text.  The place was stunning, clean but not sterile, you could feel that a lot of went into it.  Comfortable bed, great shower, cool living room and plenty of coffee in the kitchen.  There's a little porch for reading or sitting or having a glass of wine with the other guests or their friendly neighbor.  The beach is just steps away, as are some fun bars, restaurants, coffee shops.  Perfect place for a solo trip, romantic getaway, or even a place to bring a kid or two.  Without a doubt, I'll be back."
215161,11386674,2014-03-31,5390062,Stephanie,Stayed in the lovely Marina Del Rey cottage for two nights. It's cozy & clean. Surprisingly a quiet neighborhood for being one block from the beach. We walked everywhere (Abbot Kinney St. Is adorable and has the best places to eat). The bed was ridiculously comfortable & I felt so well rested. The host even left us creamer & coffee in the pantry. Not to mention a welcoming bottle of pinot noir when we arrived! My favorite. Seriously was an awesome getaway. I've been telling my friends all about it. We rollerbladed in Venice Beach and I only took a cab once to go to a soul/funk night in LA. Such a fun trip!
215161,13358417,2014-05-26,14383133,Leslie,I rented the marina bungalow for quick stay for my family. Thomasina and he husband were great hosts! The bungalow was very cozy and clean. The location was perfect- it's quick walk to the beach and on a quite street. I would recommend the bungalow to friends and family. My family plans to use the bungalow for future visits! <br/>

Everything was clean, and there was tea, coffee, and even wine set out for us. We sat out on the porch almost every morning for breakfast and watched the hummingbirds flit around.  She loved all the vegetation and that it was walking distance to the beach, restaurants and short drive to the airport.    We were there on a Monday, which is street cleaning on one side so parking was a little dodgy but other than that it was a perfect place to stay.  Thomasina was also really responsive and coordinated everything so check in/out was super convenient."

Only a block from the beach.  This was a trip with my 16 yr old great niece.  She like staying at the bungalow and the beach more than visiting other areas of LAX.  I would definitely recommend this place to others.

215161,14813339,2014-06-27,11808865,Ieva,"Good, short walk to the beach...longer walk to Venice Boardwalk(with a 2 year old) parking can be difficult but we always lucked out."
<br/>Would definitely return!!,,,,,
"<br/>The wine hit the spot!\"",,,,,
215161,15319269,2014-07-07,15341544,Mara,"My boyfriend and I looked at a lot of places on airbnb and we're really glad we chose this one. It was clean, airy, comfortable, within walking distance of the beach and the canals, and convenient to stores and restaurants. The kitchen is well-stocked and well-laid out, and we found it very easy to cook during our stay, which was great. We were also happy to find a standing fan, which cooled the bedroom down perfectly at night, in the closet (+ two beach chairs which we never got to use). Would stay again!"
215161,15570633,2014-07-12,11333580,Melanie,"This is a magic, lovely place I can highly recommend! Just a one minute walk to the beach, 2 minutes to an awesome yogastudio and 3 minutes to fantastic restaurants and bars, where all the locals hang out."
<br/>The patio is so beautiful and the whole appartement very quiet. It gets pretty hot in the bedroom during summer,but that did not bother us too much.,,,,
<br/>Very kind contact with thomasino,who was not in town but just a phonecall away in case we needed anything. We did not,"we were perfectly happy! \"",,,
7992,895097063923162243,2023-05-19,7892595,Mark,Great little spot in Atwater Village. Tom was very communicative and the space was just what we needed. It was clean and had everything we could have required<br/>Parking was easy too!
7992,895822063149966274,2023-05-20,86215998,Courtney,"Very cozy and safe Airbnb! Tom was there to greet us and show us the space. There is another Airbnb on property and the owners house but we felt like we had privacy and a safe space, which is all you need! Our space was clean and the bed/pillows were super comfortable! I would definitely book again here in the future!"
7992,896451663016403787,2023-05-21,429684079,Tina,"Really well-located spot in LA. It’s super close to I-5 in a good way, yet very much in a neighborhoody neighborhood with lots of sidewalks and few hills — perfect for my morning run, or dog walks. It’s compact, but smartly appointed, stylish and comfy. Highly recommend."
7992,903783219198543717,2023-05-31,20417129,Silvia,"Hemos tenido una estancia genial en el apartamento de Tom. Tiene todo lo necesario (incluso dejó snacks!) y está situado en un barrio muy tranquilo. Tom ha sido muy atento y amable, y nos ha ayudado. ¡100% recomendado!"
7992,905244589542765128,2023-06-02,38427796,Bill & Emily,"We had a wonderful stay. The room is cozy, and the hosts are friendly and generous. They gave us amazing recommendations for local restaurants and things to do. We will totally rebook when we are visiting family in LA. We are happy to have found a such a nice place in a cute neighborhood. The breakfast options within walking distance alone are worth the trip! Thank you!"

7992,916725840025585921,2023-06-18,38192930,Jackie,"We had a great stay and Tom and Heidi were so nice & responsive. There is plentiful street parking, and lots of restaurants and shops within walking distance.<br/>This unit's entrance is through the backyard, which is shared with the hosts and the other rental on the property. When other guests are in the backyard, their talking and activities can be heard, and they will be able to see you enter and exit this unit. This wasn't an issue for us as the other guests were respectful, though they were early risers and it was slightly less private than we anticipated."
7992,921140474645961806,2023-06-24,98873447,Ava,Tom and his wife were so friendly and helpful during my stay. The space was perfect for what I needed it for - a work trip - and I loved the neighborhood. I felt safe getting back late at night and loved the local spots that were walking distance from their house. Would definitely stay again!

7992,926183768974180805,2023-07-01,138614440,Donghyun,"Tom was a thoughtful and attentive host. Communication was always easy and fast. The studio had everything we needed. The driveway felt slightly narrow, but at night he took care of the car so we didn't have to worry about it. The location was also great. Since it was not at the commercial center of the city so it was quiet, but it was also not far from important places such as Griffith, Hollywood, and Koreatown, etc. We truly enjoyed staying at his place."
7992,926937655454789876,2023-07-02,368479143,Marcela,"Great stay, Tom was an amazing host making sure we were comfortable and had everything we need. Thank you Tom!"

7992,1007365474337869844,2023-10-21,117829887,Katherine,"This is what all Airbnbs should strive to be like! The guesthouse was so cozy and I felt right at home. Tom and Heidi are the best hosts I’ve ever met! They really have thought of all possible ways to make staying at their place comfortable and a great experience. They are so friendly, make sure you have everything you need and also have great local recommendations. Everything was so well stocked - daily amenities, cookware, appliances, etc. It’s also super clean and well taken care of. Their yard is beautiful too. Loved staying here 10/10"

215161,16602468,2014-07-30,1392530,Marby,"I had a wonderful stay at Thomasina's bungalow. It was really nice being a block from the beach, and had all the amenities one could want. It was warmer and more humid than I remember, but fans were thoughtfully provided. Parking can be a little challenging, but had no problem finding a spot. Thanks Thomasina, I had a wonderful stay!"
215161,16806313,2014-08-02,501690,Elena,"Fantastic communication and attention to detail. The place was delightful and everything I could possibly need was provided (towels, condiments, miscellaneous toiletries, comfy pillows, etc.).  Quiet, charming, great location, clean."
215161,17125778,2014-08-07,893871,Katharina,"Thomasina's apartement is wonderful. It's really spacious and perfectly located in a quiet area near the beach. You find everything you Need in the apartement and it is really clean. Thomasina was easy to Communicate with and we could have reached her very easily, in Case we needed anything. But everything Went fine. I Would definitely book again with Thomasina."
215161,17334335,2014-08-11,13615498,Kurt,our experience was wonderful the location was perfect. It was so quiet and peaceful. thomasina was very helpful because we didn't know if we should rent a car or not. we are so glad we did  not parking would have been difficult and we really did not need one. we could walk to everything . the house was very clean and nice. there was market close by to get what we needed. we would stay there again. loved it!!!!!
215161,18054509,2014-08-21,15864511,Charlotte,"Thomasina was the best host you can have. We rented her cosy bungalow for our honeymoon and she had prepared the bungalow so romantic for us with flowers, wine, strawberrys etc.<br/>She also checked in on us to see if we had some questions or anything we were missing. <br/>The place was very nice and fresh, it had a patio where we could sig and relax in the evenings. The beach was walking distance away, and we could always find parking in the evenings.<br/>I highly recomend this place and if we come back to LA again we would very much like to stay here again."
215161,18436907,2014-08-26,19701758,Anson,"The space, the host, the neighbors, location, the process was all amazing. Dont have anything negative to say. Highly recommend!"
215161,19340464,2014-09-10,20548516,Eva,"It is a cosy place, very close to the beach in a nice and qiet neighbourhood. It was clean and provided everything we needed. We  especially loved having breakfast on the nice little porch in front of the bungalow.  Thomasina and her husband Steve are  extremly nice hosts communication was very easy. We would definitely book with them again."
215161,23250773,2014-11-26,23114677,Kyla,Thomasina! Thank you so much for your hospitality! The bungalow was clean and comfortable. There was plenty of space for me and my son. The bed was just right and we made great use of washer and dryer! The location was perfect and an easy walk to the beach and restaurants. The kitchen was well stocked with everything we could need for cooking our own meals. The only thing to know is that you can hear every sound from outside and from the neighbors. There seems to always be some kind of street noise from trash trucks or deliveries. Not a deal breaker just an expectation to have when you book. Thomasina and her husband were so so nice and made us feel at home. Thank you again!
215161,24190751,2014-12-22,23411550,Charles,"This was a long trip away from home during the holiday season.  Upon arrival Thomasina was there to greet me and make me feel so welcome.  The house was open, the lights were on, welcome notes on the chalkboard and a bottle of wine all made feel less anxious about a long trip."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The house was ever so convenient,the furniture was comfortable and Thomasina has every thing you need to live your normal life and find a great routine:  All of the kitchenware,cutlery,cookware,household items,fresh towels.  All of the little things are there and you do not need anything.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The neighbourhood was just what I had hoped.  A quick walk to the beach,close to stores and restaurants and lovely walks along the canal.  The neighbours made you feel welcome and there is a nice mix of long-term tenants and short term rentals to give the community a nice feel.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Modern technology requirements were there.  The Wifi ran flawlessly,a strong signal made working from home easy and the signal even reached out nicely on to the deck.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Overall I could not recommend the house more.  The house was better than advertised but that is not what impressed me the most.  It was all of the little things that made living there so easy.  Thomasina has thought of everything.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>Thank you for making a difficult trip so easy.  \"",,,,,
215161,24591328,2014-12-31,3151255,Kate,"We had a wonderful stay at Thomasina's bungalow! The neighborhood really cannot be beat. You are walking distance to restaurants, coffee shops, bars and the Venice Pier (great sunsets). And of course just a hop to the beach and the boardwalk, where you can rent bikes."
<br/>The house is quite spacious and my husband,two-year old and I were very comfortable. The living area is very cozy and the kitchen is large and well-equipped. The street parking is also very easy. Thank you for your hospitality,"Thomasina! \"",,,
215161,25390605,2015-01-14,16376579,Eva,"A wonderful place to stay! Such welcoming, caring hosts!"

215161,27413732,2015-03-03,28236780,Anna,"Perfect location and size for two. Loved the decor! She was super sweet to bring me cupcakes for my bday. Had a little hiccup when we arrived as the cleaning was not complete, however it was still a beautiful stay!"
215161,27523088,2015-03-06,2867689,Duncan,Lovely place and great location. Highly recommended.
215161,28937517,2015-04-01,23411550,Charles,"Thomasina's bungalows are becoming my home away from home.  This is a wonderful place to stay, the houses are well kept and stocked with everything you need.  The neighbours really add to the community atmosphere and make the stay even more enjoyable."
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>Thomasina is a great host and is always is checking in to make sure you are ok and if you need anything.  Could not recommend her places more.  \"",,,,,
215161,33704322,2015-05-31,4349074,Christi,I got this place for my parents visiting out of town and it couldn't have been more perfect!! There was a bottle of wine waiting for them upon arrival and it just got better from there!! This is now the only place my parents want to stay when they come to LA for a visit!!
215161,35613427,2015-06-20,35820430,Julie,Thank you Thomasina and Steve for making us feel welcome! The house is just as beautiful as the pictures and very short walk to the beach.
<br/>Parking is a little bit tricky,"but like the listing says you can rent a spot nearby for your stay. \"",,,,
215161,36265409,2015-06-27,29458344,John,A delightful stay in a wonderful location.

215161,38601739,2015-07-17,33601320,Jill,We had the most amazing time in LA and one of the highlights was staying in Thomasina's bungalow.  She made us feel very welcome and made herself available whenever we needed. We found the bungalow to be a very special and romantic place.  It is cozy and close to the beach. I am a writer and found it to be a creative and inspiring place to be. I would recommend this place to everyone. We definitely hope to return.
215161,38850917,2015-07-19,11712301,Kathy,Our stay was fantastic.  Thomasina was there when I arrived which was a treat to get a tour from her along with recommendations in the area.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The bungalow,location and entire courtyard area was amazing.  She had fresh flowers,some snacks and wine ready for our arrival.  The flowers were such a sweet touch.  The location was ideal for getting to the beach and main strip of Venice Beach but far enough removed as well.  Best of both worlds!  Neighbors were very nice and added to the experience of visiting and chatting while sitting outside enjoying the patio!,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>For any visits to the LA area,I hope to stay here again.  Proximity to the airport,beaches,"Santa Monica and even downtown just felt so easy and centrally located.  The bungalow was so comfortable there were times I didn't want to leave which never happens on vacation!\"",,
215161,39628539,2015-07-25,14766943,Ashley,"We loved Thomasina's little bungalow! So quaint, charming and unique, plus a super quick walk to the beach and our new favorite coffee shop, The Cow's End. This was a mother/daughter trip and my mom's first airbnb experience-she's now a believer thanks to the great hospitality from Thomasina! Thomasina ensured we had everything we needed, was so welcoming and made sure we were taken care of. Thanks for a great stay!"
215161,40727948,2015-08-02,31898715,Rachael,"We stayed at Thomasina's place for a week the last week in July 2015 and had the most amazing time. The location. The decor. The effort put in to make the unit a vacation dream is incredible. Coffee and creamer.  Veggie platter. Fairy lights. Towels galore. Washer and dryer. Ur own patio. Cable. Full kitchen. Full size fridge.  Beach chairs. Umbrella. Bikes. There is to much to mention.<br/>Thomasina was warm, welcoming and so sweet. We had an amazing time. <br/>My only suggestion would be to take advantage of the car parking space that is offered if u r staying over a holiday period or on a Friday/Saturday night.  Take it!!!"
215161,41458235,2015-08-07,10564269,Seth,"The bungalow was just as it looks in the picture. Thomasina was an amazing host- she waited until we got there and had put some snacks and a bottle of wine for us in the kitchen. It is an amazing location, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. I would stay here again in a heartbeat."
215161,41761699,2015-08-09,1530556,Madhvi,Thomasina was an excellent host. She was very caring and checked in with us to make sure we have everything we need. We really appreciated her warmth and kindness.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The lovely beach bungalow was even better than the pictures. It was just perfect with an excellent location to the beach and restaurants. We were greeted with a bottle of wine and a charming home. I'm rarely impressed and she certainly deserved an A+!,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>My husband and I are vacation snobs from San Francisco. Thomasina's bungalow exceeded our expectations. We truly felt we got much more than the cost of the rental. We were thrilled!\"",,,,,
63416,451366999,2019-05-11,103399985,Georgia,Everything was perfect! Vincenzo was super friendly and so welcoming. There was a mix up with the room but Vincenzo went above and beyond to help us out by upgrading us to another room! Fantastic stay and will definitely be returning :D
63416,666884626,2020-09-21,332225373,Jasmin,"Literally, the beautifulest experience if you’re into a great energetical space. Vincenzo & Roman just exude peace and it prevails all over the house! Super clean and decorated, huge space, inside & out, and FANTASTIC VIEW of Hollywood, the Hollywood sign, and LA ! my pup LOVED EVERYTHING too! Just Amazing, if you’re reading this to get a feel of whether to book or not, DONT THINK TWICE! Book NOWWWW"
63416,670266147,2020-10-02,205818826,Cynthia,"The pictures don’t do this place justice. Great views, great location, and great host. You can’t go wrong with choosing this location."
63416,390562229125020605,2021-06-22,318383,Susan,"Wish I could give this place 10 stars. Firstly Vincenzo was so attentive and helpful. He really went out of his way to make sure we had everything we needed and gave  great recommendations on where to go and what to do in the area. The house is gorgeous. So cute. The view is 10 out of 10. In a perfect area close to grocery stores. We ate at beachwood cafe up the street from the house everyday. The food was delicious there and the vibe was really nice. Don’t second guess booking this place, you won’t regret it."
63416,397878691549157924,2021-07-02,186569030,Anish,"Starting from the picture perfect views from the deck to the meticulously decorated interiors, combined with the fantastic graciousness of the host easily makes it the to go place for a visit in the city. Possibly the best Airbnb we've stayed at.. Had read other reviews saying the same but had to see it to believe it was indeed perfect.."
63416,402201783747661015,2021-07-08,8785246,Jesse,"This place is really special--nestled atop a hill, yet close to to both the bustling dual cultures of urban Hollywood and artsy Los Feliz.   It's also especially convenient to the quiet, historic beauty of the Beachwood Canyon neighborhood and nearby Griffith Park--which were the twin highlights of the location for me.  And the views are as advertised if not more so!  I especially enjoyed falling asleep looking across the canyon at the glow of the historic Griffith Park Observatory.  Vincenzo has a very nuanced social grace with guests--a rare skill, and a quality I greatly appreciated.  We interacted the perfect amount for my tastes.  I would totally recommend this place to friends and if I get the opportunity again, I will return myself."
63416,425334690110153112,2021-08-09,255415669,Max,"Vincenzo is very clear in communicating everything you need to know, is willing to provide any help he can in terms of tourism or hospitality, and is a very friendly individual. If this spot is within your budget, it is a fun way to get the experience of living in Hollywood."

He also gave some great nearby food and restaurant recommendations as well. The house, views and location were spectacular!  You won't regret booking and staying at Vince's place."
63416,444170020214123508,2021-09-04,71735112,Sam,We had a great 2 night stay with Vincenzo. The room was clean and spacious. Great view of everything LA is known for. Vincenzo is very hospitable and friendly and accommodated our late arrival. We'd love to come back for a longer stay!

63416,589211225370262628,2022-03-23,17969405,Lauren,"I normally have pretty good luck picking Airbnbs, but this was by far the best place I've ever stayed. The room and bathroom are completely private, so it's really like having a gorgeous villa to yourself in the hills, and Vincenzo is like a super helpful friendly neighbor. The safe, remote location and parking are ideal for LA. And that view! I texted all of my friends that they had to stay here when they come to town for the view alone, but everything else was amazing as well. Can't wait to come back!"
8021,6017,2009-07-23,26508,Bella,This was our favourite place to stay of our whole trip of the states. I was so nice to feel at home after being away for so long.

<br/>First our room was very clean,beautifull decorated as you can see on her profile photo's. We are also no early-birds and leaving the end of the morning or arriving late in the evening/night was not a problem at all!,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>We even arrived at 2 AM at night after a long and beautifull drive from San Francisco over the US1 what was not a problem for Sherree: wonderfull! The first morning she made us some great french toast! Really tasty!,,,,,

The location was brilliant as well. Can't rave enough about how much we enjoyed our time with her. And as a guide to LA, you won't find better. She went out of her way to give us info, maps and suggestions of what to do and when. We just loved meeting her and spending time in her fabulous home."

My trip to LA was made so much better due to staying with her.  Read all the reviews below, they are all completely spot on.  She's kind and helpful and she's just brilliant really.  I don't think you could find a nicer place to stay."
8021,14305,2009-10-19,8289,Ginger,"Sherree should own her own B&B; she is the quintesscencial hostess with the mostess.  Rarely have I met a lady so fun and hospitable. Her home looked like it was ripped from the pages of Elle Decor; it is an upstairs duplex, quite a charming and delighfully vintage Old Hollywood-style home, with a great location walking distance from the fun shops of Robertson (ladies, gasp!) Sherree is a Martha Stewart of sorts, having the gift to cook, garden, host, and definitely decorate.  The bedroom is lovely and quaint off of the kitchen, with beautiful furnishings and its own bathroom. Sherree is a whiz in the kitchen, and even let me join her for a delicious dinner one night which she amazingly cooked from scratch. I consider Sherree someone I would want to personally hang out with again, and her home is beautiful."
8021,15750,2009-11-01,27546,Ebba,"We absolutely enjoyed our stay with Sherree. The location is convenient by car or by foot, and her home is very inviting and comfortable. She's friendly and fun and she made us feel right at home. Ebba"

A comfortable setting in a private home; amenities supplied and the hosts are generous with help and tips. They are living in their home, so if you want a spot all to yourselves, this is not it. That said, there is no intrusiveness or interference from the hosts. High recommend!"
63416,594227931532045219,2022-03-30,12833209,Chloe,"The location was very convenient, and the views can’t be beat. Vincenzo was an incredibly accommodating and gracious host, and we’d be glad to stay again!"
63416,595665157646551936,2022-04-01,5740204,Lena,The most charming hosts who did their very best to make our stay special! The Hollywood Sign and Hills and Downtown views were priceless and we felt very safe and comfortable staying with them. <br/>Vincenzo made us a lovely coffee in the morning - the perfect start into a LA day. Everything is close by and since their house is on a small hill they even helped us with our heavy luggage! Thank you very much again for everything. Wishing you all the best. Elke & Lena
63416,609443832717281720,2022-04-20,34930115,Keresse,"I’m not one to usually book a room in someone’s home, but this felt like a friend the moment I walked in. Just 2 amazing humans I got the pleasure of meeting. Felt 100% safe and comfortable. The room was private with my own entrance. Everything was clean. And honestly, you cannot ask for better hosts. Seriously I mean that. Vincenzo and his partner are really amazing humans. Plus he has lots of plants so that’s a plus. I got to try Armenian coffee which was AMAZING. The oh can’t forget the views! Literally you can beat seeing the Hollywood sign and enjoying the views on the porch. Cute little walking distance to a lovely breakfast place and was a perfect day for a walk. 100% recommend."
63416,613067319949206934,2022-04-25,74351466,Marina,"My mum and I spent a weekend at Vincenzo's place during our west coast roadtrip and it was honestly the best accommodation of our whole trip. The views are amazing, the place is fantastic and the hosts are lovely - everything was just perfect and exactly as described. We also got the best coffee of our whole trip from Vincenzo and waking up to have good coffee on the balkony right under the Hollywood sign was very special. We would love to return to the US just to spend more time in LA."
63416,624652129886657032,2022-05-11,79860181,Heidi,"This house is in the most idyllic location with views of the Hollywood sign and downtown LA from the beautiful veranda. <br/>The room is plenty big enough, with storage and it’s own entrance to come and go from. <br/>We loved every second here and anyone would be lucky to stay."
63416,626104083915750439,2022-05-13,61633756,André,"The absolute best airbnb we have experienced so far. A very good location between hollywood sign, griffith obervatorium and downtown L.A. You can get to the walk of fame in just a few minutes. In addition, there is the very helpful and super nice nature of Vinzenco. He helped us a lot to get an overview of the city and gave us some interesting information. Thank you very much and we will definitely be back!"
63416,628348217244793355,2022-05-16,134242960,Piotr,"The place is simply amazing. The price is of course higher than an average Airbnb in LA, but morning, as well as evening views of the Hollywood hills and the sign on one side, and downtown LA on the other side (the “views from bed” part is 100% true!) is worth every USD spent. And Vincenzo is so friendly and helpful, and he can offer tons of valuable guidance on where to go, what to eat etc. Just go there!"
63416,630517788210344690,2022-05-19,56831722,Flora,"Vincenzo est un hôte merveilleux, chaleureux et bienveillant.<br/>Ce fut un plaisir de profiter de cette parenthèse à Los Angeles avec une terrasse des plus agréables. <br/>Je recommande définitivement cet endroit !"

Whether that includes restaurant recommendations, places to go, things to see, & The history and culture of Hollywood and LA. Every place that was recommended was excellent. Will be coming back for a Disney trip and wouldn't think of staying anywhere but here. The views are what sold me and let me tell you the pictures in the listing do it no justice. You really have to see it to believe how awesome it really is."
63416,731250822603754876,2022-10-05,62728812,Shannon,"We loved staying at Vincenzo and Romans place!<br/>breathtaking views of the Hollywood Sign and downtown LA, lots of birds, squirrels and rabbits around the gardens and so quiet and peaceful!<br/>Vincenzo was super helpful and knowledgeable, nothing was too much trouble, he even gave us a lift into town.<br/>Beachwood market and cafe are close by, as are restruants and shops, there's also Dash busses to take you up and down Beachwood.<br/>The place was super clean and I would 100% recommend it!<br/>Can't wait to return!"

215161,42854691,2015-08-16,33900346,Joseph,Staying at the Marina Beach Bungalow was amazing!  Thomasina was an excellent host. She was very responsive and set us up perfectly for our late arrival. The place was clean and quaint. The bottle of wine and snacks we're welcoming. I could not have had a better experience and would love to stay there any time I come back to Southern California. I highly recommend staying at this spot.

215161,44928163,2015-08-30,37844860,Cliff,Thomasina welcomed us to her wonderful cottage with some treats and a bottle of wine. Everything was as clean and tasteful as we had hoped. 5 minutes walk from Washington pier and Marina Del Rey beach and 10 minutes from Venice beach was fantastic.

After a tumultuous travel we could relax near the beach. We didn't even have to forage for a glass of wine! Thomasina made arriving and leaving easy; with no one coming the day of our departure we were able to check-out later, which changed hectic to relaxed!"
<br/>So great to be able to make coffee in the morning and head out to the beach!,,,,,

The interior is beautifully decorated and very comfortable, and there were plenty of extra towels and toiletries. I initially couldn't find the house and had to call Thomasina at a pretty late hour for help, but she was incredibly gracious and helpful and immediately made me feel welcome. Thanks again for the lovely stay Thomasina - I hope I can come back soon and stay again!"
215161,64440069,2016-03-04,27268800,Yolanda,"We were welcomed with a bottle of lovely wine, lights glowing and a very clean and inviting space -- much of which you see in the pictures.  In fact, we were sorry we had booked another space as we felt so at home and there was so much more to do.  Well equipment kitchen and nice bathroom.  Perfect for a couple and the location is exceptional.  I would highly recommend this place to others and will keep Thomasina's place in mind for future travel."
215161,65518714,2016-03-15,4704104,Laura,We LOVED this bungalow!! It so so beautifully appointed and is in a perfect west side LA location. It was easy to walk everywhere and steps away from the beach. The place feels super safe and the bed was so comfortable.<br/>We were sad we had to leave!! Could've easily moved in. Perfect perfect beach pad.<br/>Thomasina was excellent with communication and super helpful. Couldn't recommend strongly enough!

We are not wine drinkers but there was a bottle of wine and two glasses on the table for us.  The location was perfect for us; literally two blocks west to the sand of the beach, half a block East to the Venice Canal and three blocks north to the main street with all the shops, restaurants, the Venice pier and the beginning of the Venice Beach boardwalk.  Five to ten minutes from LAX."

Great stay wonderful lady. Thanks a lot!
8021,33424,2010-04-04,101553,Isabella,"Sherry is a great hostess,very friendly and easy to talk to. She even made a map of the local bars and hangouts for us to visit. She diffently has great taste. The house had a warm inviting feel to it, and the bed was a dream to sleep in. Sherry provided us with privacy and our own entry way. If she does ask you what you want for breakfast, order the Frensh toast it was awesome! Thanks Sherry for your Hospitality."
8021,37350,2010-04-23,34372,Carol,"Sherree is a great hostess, and made us feel like old friends as soon as we met her!  Her home is beautiful and the bed is soooooo comfortable.

Sherree is first and foremost a great person and I am sure that even if she lived in a cardboard box you would enjoy your stay! The house is as gorgeous as the pictures and every bit as comfortable as they look! We slept like logs and felt safe and contented in this part of LA! Easy access to public transport if you need it and walk to cool places too. We had delicious breakfasts and even got homemade berry/cherry cobbler and margaritas OH YEAH! This is the place if you want luxury living on a budget! We loved it and Sherree, well thanks for being such an amazing host and new found friend!!"
8021,64296,2010-07-13,136723,Tiffany,"My husband and I used Airbnb for the 1st time and had the most wonderful experience with Sherree! She was an incredible host as mentioned in previous reviews. We wanted to stay in the Bev. Hills area since it was pretty much in the middle of all the sight-seeing/activities we wanted to do and it is a GREAT location! Not only that, but she does make YUMMY breakfasts and makes great suggestions on what to do/where to eat in the area :-) Her place is very homey and inviting and she does know the ins and outs of LA. We absolutely LOVED it and would definitely be back if we're in the Bev. Hills area again!!"

She is a perfect host and even offered 2 cook us breakfast....MY WIFE DOESNT EVEN DO THAT!!  Her house looks like something out of a magazine(the good ones not the trashy kind) U can tell she put so much time and thought into decorating.  Its that added bonus that makes u feel at home.  Thank u 4 all your hospitality and kindness.  U ROCK!!
8021,66026,2010-07-18,155681,Beth,We had the good fortune to find Sherree's lovely home on Airbnb.  It was our first experience and we loved it.  Sherree could not have been a more gracious host. Her home just oozes spanish charm.  Our room was large and comfortable with every amenety you could possibly want.
<br/>The adjoining bath had a great soaking tub and plenty of fresh towels and was very clean.  We had the pleasure of spending a little time with Sherree and enjoyed her hospitality and sense of humor.  She baked us a peach and berry cobbler one evening that was to die for.  Breakfast was just as good although we missed out on her famous french toast as we opted for more cobbler for breakfast.  The neighborhood is great and you can walk to restaurants nearby if you choose.  She was a good tour guide.  We couldn't have had a better time.  Thanks Sherree for everything.  We hope to stay again sometime.,,,,,

The location was great, only 2 blocks from the beach and all the shops and restaurants on Washington st. The only downfall was the parking. We rented a car for our vacation so we could go all around LA and surrounding areas but each day we came back, there were never any parking spots. We would circle the entire perimeter several times and end up parking blocks and blocks away. Just be aware of that. Other than that, it was a great place to stay!"
215161,71168413,2016-04-24,58056424,Carole,The host was very welcoming - left us candies and a bottle of wine. The bungalow was perfect for the two of us - beautiful LR and very functional kitchen. I loved best the patio out front - perfect for early morning coffee and evening wine. The location - literally two short blocks from beach and many good restaurants. Would definitely book again.
215161,73214988,2016-05-07,50361352,Victoria,"Thomasina was a wonderful host! It was our first time in California and first Air BnB.  The place had beautiful decorations,when we arrived we were welcomed with wine and fresh flowers inside the bungalow.  The listing was extremely accurate to her photos and descriptions.  This location is ideal as it is a quick walk to the beach.  The street actually ends and the beach begins.  We also loved the outdoor plants and lights and how well kept everything was.  It made for a relaxing atmosphere.  There were bonuses we did not even expect such as there was an umbrella and beach chairs for us to borrow for the beach!  The bed was also very comfortable which is always important.  We would recommend anyone looking for some R&R to stay here and experience all that Marina del Rey / Venice has to offer!"

(Hollywood sign, down town view and mountain view!!)<br/>한국인 분들 차 있으시면 꼭 이 곳으로 가보세요. 밤에 사이렌 소리도 안들리고 안전해요. 침대도 푹신하고 호스트와 분리된 개별 화장실이 있어요. <br/>It's a shame that we couldn't talk much because our couple was very shy. Next time we go, we talk more!"

The place has been decorated beautifully and feels quite homely + the snack bar was an added bonus. Do not hesitate to book your stay here - you will truly be satisfied with the location, comfort, and ambiance!"
63416,805197430400802264,2023-01-15,450318939,Lance,"Great place to stay in the beautiful Hollywood Hills. Vincenzo was extremely friendly, knowledgeable and helpful. My daughter had an allergic reaction to her meal at a restaurant, and broke out in Hives shortly after we returned to the property, Vincenzo went out of his way to contact two sept neighbors and WALKED TO THEIR HOMES TO RETRIEVE allergy medicine for her. Mind you, this was around 9:30 at night! We were very appreciative of his “above and beyond” assistance. His ad tells all you need to know about the property and surrounding area, and is completely accurate, so no need to repeat here. Highly satisfied with our experience."
63416,811667482955929973,2023-01-24,464620206,Hanna,"I can’t say enough about my stay at Vincenzo’s house. Vincenzo and Roman were so warm and welcoming, and the hospitality was unmatched! From recommendations for local cafes and nightlife, walkable things to visit, an extremely comfortable bed, and offering espresso or tea at all hours of the day or night, staying here was truly a lovely experience. The views are immaculate, the neighborhood establishments are great, and staying here felt more like visiting old friends than renting part of someone’s home. I highly recommend this location and host, and would definitely stay again."

He was always attentive, if i needed anything or suggestions to local activites and restaurants. He even offered to walk me around the me<br/>neighborhood and made me an amazing authentic Italian Expresso.<br/>Highly recommend. His home was exactly what i need to getaway for the business. Very tranquil home with a deck with views of the Hollywood sign and Griffith Observatory. You could see downtown LA from the bedroom. I enjoyed the beautiful sunrise every morning."

They are the most beautiful souls I have ever come across in Los Angeles.<br/>The host communicates very well, and very quickly. The house is very clean, and has easy access to everything! <br/>The images attached are EXACTLY as advertised, and the view of the Hollywood sign is breathtaking! Everything about this place is just spectacular! I have already recommended this place to friends and family, and I’ll certainly be returning! <br/>I HIGHLY recommend booking this gorgeous place!!"

Sherree was extremely helpful with local info on places to go, things to do, places to eat outside of the normal tourist traps.  Breakfast was first class and we enjoyed her company alongisde freshly made margaritas and nice wines :) This was our first airbnb experience and will definately do again.  Thanks Sherree and hope to see you soon."

Owners were so charming, helpful and responsive and the atmosphere couldn't have been more warm and homey. And then of course, the views!!! Spell binding both at night and in the day, as far as you can see. Neighborhood was safe and quiet, bed comfortable and kitchen accessible. Would definitely stay again and would love to see both owners again!"

Vincenzo was really helpful and knowledgeable about local recommendations <br/>The accommodation was exactly as described and facilities were great. E.g. kitchen, shared spaces, laundry, bathroom & private space. <br/>Views from private patio were fantastic - clear views of Hollywood sign, Griffiths observatory and Downtown. <br/>Great experience, would highly recommend!"
63416,924022347971837088,2023-06-28,443439444,Callie,"It still feels like maybe it was a dream. But I’m pretty sure I actually stayed in a Hollywood Hills home for a few days. Because I couldn’t conjure up those breathtaking views by myself, with the Hollywood Sign and Griffith Observatory out my window, and the downtown skyline from the foot of my bed. I didn’t quite understand how I was to live with a host, but Vincenzo made my feel like his friend, and we’d meet in the kitchen to talk about my day. It was a short trip through the kitchen to access my private restroom and shower, plus I got to use the kitchen for the sink and refrigerator storage, and I could have used the sizeable stove. I wish I would have had more vacation downtime to just lounge on the patio!"
63416,930591225412185266,2023-07-07,49238739,Daniel,"My girlfriend and I spent a few nights at Vincenzo’s place and we loved it. We felt right at home. Vincenzo’s suggested lots of great restaurants and bars. <br/>The house, room and bathroom were spotless and super comfy. We loved our stay there. <br/>The view is great and you can see both - downtown LA and the Hollywood sign. <br/>We would definitely recommend! 10/10"

Vincenzo was beyond accommodating, kind, friendly; everything you’d hope for in a host. The room was incredible; snuggled in between a celebrity filled neighborhood with stunning views of the hollywood sign, griffith observatory, and downtown LA. The room had its own AC controllable AC unit, TV with multiple streaming platforms, robes for showering, a private restroom. I could go on and on. I felt lucky to find this gem, cannot wait to return!"
63416,985603821383818456,2023-09-21,536388214,Timothy,Great place and Vinny was a very welcoming host. <br/>My only notable minor criticism was street parking/general navigation right near the property was a bit of a pain due to the narrow/hilly roads and there was always other vehicles parked on the street nearest the steps up necessitating a bit of a walk (uphill) to the property.

I was able to enjoy the big patio in front of the house.  The place was very quiet, allowing me good sleep at night.  Vincenzo was super nice - greeted me in person when I arrived and helped with suitcases when checking in and out.  I hiked along the trail Vincenzo recommended and it has great views and mild.  I also checked out the cafe within eight minutes' walk.  Overall, a great resort-like stay experience"
63416,1074112912468555600,2024-01-21,4087446,John,"Vincenzo was proactive and cordial. Much great local area and history tidbits. If you are going to Hollywood or over to the Valley, the location can’t be beat. The view is downtown and the Hollywood sign are accurate. We highly recommend this property and host."

Superclose to the beach, just as described and the bungalow was very cute and snug. <br/>Didn't have time to meet Thomasina in person but she called me when we'd checked in just to make sure everything was in order and she checked in again a couple of days after to make sure we had everything we needed. <br/>She went above and beyond, letting us borrow a stroller, babybed and a babyseat for the car. <br/>Can highly recommend staying here and we'll definitely come back again."

If we were to retire in LA we d look for something similar if this house wouldn t be for sale:). 2 min walk to the beach, you can do your laundry, cutest porch ever perfect for drinking your coffee in the morning. Great experience overall. Can t wait to come back:)"
8021,71144,2010-07-30,175717,David,"We had the absolute pleasure of staying with Sherree for 3 nights in her wonderful comfortable and artistic home. It's the first time we used airbnb and we've been blown away at how kind and gracious Sherree was! She cooked us breakfast each morning - scrambled eggs, blueberry pancakes, chocolate croissants and amazing cherries. She gave us ideas on things to do in LA and printed maps giving us unique walking tours to see a totally different view of LA then we would have by staying at a hotel. The room we stayed in was very comfortable with a great bed and our own bathroom with a nice bath. Thanks so much Sherree for making our trip so special! We will always remember our stay with you!"
8021,73841,2010-08-04,188155,Bob,"\"Just what we needed! We appreciated Sherree's warm hospitality and good breakfasts. And it was refreshing to be in someone's home instead of the often-too-precious full-out B&B experience. Sherree has just the right touch for making you feel welcome and supported while giving you space to relax and enjoy. Charming, nicely kept up, \"\"typical\"\" LA house (probably Spanish Mission Revival with a Morish twist"
8021,80291,2010-08-17,187791,Nick,"My brother and I had just moved to LA and we were staying with Sherree while we looked for an apartment. Sherree was a fountain of knowledge about pretty much every subject we asked about and was extremly helpful in our search as well as with general places to go. Breakfast was always fantastic (particularly the french toast) and her home was a joy to be in. Really, I cannot recommed her enough."
8021,84996,2010-08-26,181847,Alex And Melanie,"Its hard to know what to add to the already rave reviews about Sherree and her wonderful home: Drinking a cup of great coffee with the light shining into the sunroom, fresh baked banana bread, a glass of wine offered on a lovely patio in the evening, a very comfortable bed and connecting bath. But the highlight is Sherree herself. Generous,stimulating, and laugh out loud funny, you can't find a better hostess. After long days of sight seeing, it felt like returning home. We would come back to LA (from Seattle)to stay at the B&B just to visit Sherree. I would gladly send my newly launched college freshman daughter to her B&B if she needed some rest and nurturing."
8021,103205,2010-09-23,88304,Daniel & Ildi,"Sherree was a very kind hostess. She gave us many tips what to do in LA. She even offered us to make breakfast each morning.Even when she had to leave the house in the morning she prepared us some tea and coffee. Her house is very nicely decorated and our room was very clean. She has a puppy, who is really cute. Unfortunately the bathroom only has a tub, but she offered us to use her shower. Her house is in a great location and we felt safe and welcomed. There was a good parking situation. There are some nice shops and cafes right around the corner. We were allowed to use her TV and her living room every time we wanted. We would definitely recommend everybody to stay at her beautiful home."

Go to any place she recommends! dont doubt her taste!"

<br/>The neighborhood is very convenient if you have a car,like us. It is in the middle of everywhere you want to visit (on the north half) in a very quiet and safe neighborhood. In any case,LA is the city of cars,"so dont expect \"\"walking distance\"\" to things (sadly).",,

When I arrived, the bungalow was so welcoming, with little amenities left for me by my host, clean, music playing and everything I needed. The photos perfectly represented the property - the bungalow was so special - and my host was a quick phone call away when I had a question.  The location was perfect and I felt safe walking to and from the property at night, even when I was alone. I was able to easily find parking on the street.

There was  Plenty of Parking, and the Garden Suite was Private, Tastefully Decorated and Beautifully Done.  It was so great to be in a home instead of a hotel!

<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Sherree's home is gorgeous - She's created a space that feels so nice to come home to,whether it's from a day at work or a nice day exploring the city. And speaking of exploring,Sherree is the best resource out there to help figure out where to go,what to do,and the best way to get there.,

We had a great time in LA and the suite was light and airy and it was great to be able to sit out in the garden to have breakfast in the gorgeous LA sunshine.  The kitchen is perfectly servicable and the bathroom is nice and big.  There is no area for entertaining friends indoors but the garden more than makes up for this.  The absolute best part of this place (apart from our lovely hosts) is the hot tub.  Its just so nice to come back after driving around the city to soak in this fabulous tub.

They absolutely respected our privacy and treated the rental space as if it was ours, and also made us feel welcome and totally at ease to use the backyard lounge area and hot tub. They were accommodating of our various requests and always really went above and beyond, it was like staying with friends."
<br/>They were always reachable,either their door was open or they answered their phone or called us back right away any time we had a question about anything.,,,,
<br/>The suite was lovely,the King size bed was actually more comfy than our own at home and I had amazing sleeps there.

They really think from a travelers perspective and everything is set up perfectly. In accordance with this  the bed is absolutely wonderful and it was the most comfortable I ever felt sleeping in a bed that's not my own. Extremely kind and hospitable. Just wonderful people. The new expansion looks great, and I'm certain the value for the quality is well worth it. Please enjoy if you stay here. It's likely to be a memorable experience."
67089,393902,2011-07-24,819429,Sony,"We had a great stay with Charles, Brenna and their daughter. They are super friendly and warm people.The location was perfect and close to everything. The apartment was well supplied and decorated. We had everything we needed and comfort too. The backyard is where we spent a good chunk of time. I wish I had a backyard like that at home. Hot tub, fire pit, barbecue and great company, what else could a guest ask for? Would definitely stay with them again."
67089,447453,2011-08-15,887222,Amber,"Brenna and her family were great! The location was excellent, right near downtown Culver and just a few minutes drive to Venice Beach. Brenna was very welcoming and respectful. The bed was comfortable, the shower was huge and the backyard was gorgeous. If you need a nice cute comfortable place to stay I would definitively recommend considering staying with Brenna."
67089,679537,2011-11-01,795829,Linda,"My fiance and I really enjoyed staying in this cute apartment for a month - with the giant comfy bed, the spacious bathroom and shower, plus the small courtyard with beautiful plants, flowers, and hummingbirds flying around. And, a hot tub! Our hosts were very sweet and helpful in recommending things to do in Culver City and we ended up really loving this area of LA!"
67089,1044474,2012-03-26,1617457,Ross,"An extremely beautiful home, in a great area, with the nicest hosts you can imagine. The unit is clean quiet and comfortable. There is plenty of street parking. Very close to a number of very fine restaurants. I cannot recommend this place enough."

67089,1137894,2012-04-16,1890286,Fiona,This was perfect for us and was exactly as pictured/represented.  We were easily able to have another couple over for takeout or simply to visit after dinner. Everything worked perfectly.  Brenna was also very accommodating with our arrival time (we originally told her 4pm and ending up arriving closer to 6pm).

"<br/>We hope to stay here again.\"",,,,,
67089,1165406,2012-04-22,81437,Kim,We stayed at Brenna's studio for 2 days and all we can say is that picture's match perfectly the lovely and nicely appointed studio.  The bedroom is actually separate and kitchen seemed to have everything you need although we did not cook while we were there.  Love the Plasma tv with surround speakers and very comfy bed.
67089,1201767,2012-04-30,2021745,Ed,"The place is great.  It's very secluded, separate from the main space, and the interior is very tasteful and well done while being in the middle of a great area.  My sister and girlfriend were impressed and happy with the arrangement, and the three of us were very comfortable here.  Would stay here again and definitely recommend this place."
67089,1230510,2012-05-05,485037,Deanna,This modern cottage is a great find! Very central and incredibly comfortable! Love that it has a full kitchen to cook in and the shower is wonderful. It was actually chilly while I was visiting and the fireplace in the bedroom was a perfect solution. Brenna and Charlie were super friendly and had some great suggestions of local Culver City spots to check out. Will definitely stay when I visit next.
67089,1356696,2012-05-27,1197820,Marian,"HIGHLY recommend!  The bungalow was beautiful, comfy, and airy, making it a wonderful retreat for me while working in LA.  I only wish I could have stayed longer to take advantage of the garden and fire pit!  Great location too in a residential neighborhood, close to everything!  Brenna and her family were incredibly inviting and their attention to details -- the supply of beach towels, the takeout menu book, basket of snacks and surround sound --shows how they take great care in making a stay in their bungalow a great experience!"
67089,1405798,2012-06-03,294083,Catherine,"We had a wonderful stay in Culver City with Brenna, Charlie and their lovely kids. The hosts were super nice and helpful with great tips on where to go out for food or stroll around in town."

<br/>The place had everything we needed and was super clean,neat and modern as the pictures show.,,,,
<br/>There was even a welcome basket with a bottle of red wine and some small goodies when we arrived.,,,,,

67089,1484067,2012-06-15,1610721,Sade,"After seeing this accommodation online, it looked impressive.  Three of us shared this house which was ideal for our first visit California . The bedroom was comfortable with a sofa bed in the living quarters. The house was in a great location, all tourist and shopping areas were no more than 15 mins away. Brenna was  a great host who provided us with lots information on places to see and visit. Would definitely stay here again."

They are very friendly and welcomed our family with snacks and a book listing all forms of entertainment options in the area. The bungalow was beautiful and spacious. We loved the full kitchen and the lovely, toddler friendly backyard, which was a great outlet for our daughters. They enjoyed playing with Kerala. Brenna also kindly shared her sitter who was wonderful with the girls. We highly recommend. It is a great location for anyone interested in access to the beaches and downtown Los Angeles."

67089,1770040,2012-07-22,2309304,Grace,Brenna and Charlie were great hosts!  We checked in for two nights prior to a wedding and the bungalow was amazing!  The bed was very comfortable and the showerhead was heavenly.  The location was also very prime to places we needed to get to (and we were able to take sidestreets to a lot of places since California traffic on the 405 is horrendous).  They have a very lovely home and are a very lovely family . I highly recommend this airbnb rental.

The hot tub was also nice to relax in after a full day.  We enjoyed the fire pit during the cool night too.  The bed was really comfortable, and the kitchen had everything we needed.  Brenna helped us get to the right beaches at the right times to avoid all of the traffic and crowds, and also made suggestions on where to eat, and even get a massage.  The surround sound system and DVD system was easy to use and made it feel like a theater.  We also used the Netflix service to watch a few shows.  Brenna and her family were really nice and made us feel welcome.  Thanks for a great stay."

8021,236823,2011-04-23,517995,Nóra,Sherree is a really nice host and her apartment is very well decorated. We felt very comfortable right away. The only negative thing was that there was dog hair all over our blanket.

The photos don't do Sherree justice. It's a beautifully composed home full of lovely things whilst also being both welcoming and comfortable. Sherree was just as a dream host should be, there when you need something and not when you don't. Buddy, Sherree's dog, is a perfect gentleman who we wanted to take home! In summery I would instantly recommend this home to both friends and family. Great place which we look fwd to visiting again soon! Oh, and thank you Sherree for the home made chocolate brownie! So yummy!!!"

<br/>Such a beautiful house- you have your own privacy when you want it as well as feeling completely relaxed and at home to laze in the comfy living room,watch net flicks,sit on both patios- completely feels like home.,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>She also told us insider tips such as the farmers market,flea market and a delicious italian just down the road (try the sushi on the same road too,it's divine). Sheree's breakfasts are to die for,she made sure she made our favourite thing (and made it better by putting her twist on it!)every morning- bliss! Tip: have a bath and use all the lovely products sherree puts out in your bathroom,complete pampering!,

Description is spot on...it is very clean, warm and welcoming in a great location.  Walkable to everything, but nice and quiet as well.  Thomasina was awesome to coordinate with!  Highly recommend"
215161,138403308,2017-03-19,103255557,Carla,Very cool bungalow in an awesome location. My college age daughter and friends loved it so much they want to live there now. Easy access to restaurants and beaches. Thomasina was a great host - very communicative.

215161,139848040,2017-03-26,6727363,Laura,"We enjoyed our stay in this bungalow. It's a charming, homey little place that we much preferred to staying in a condo. The location is great - just a couple of blocks to a gorgeous beach, it is also near restaurants, yet on a quiet side street. Noise was never an issue and the bed is quite comfortable. The rooms are spacious and inviting, but the kitchen could use some updates in the cookware (most renters probably eat out but we like to cook). Thomasina is friendly, helpful and easy to communicate with, yet not intrusive. Nice spot for a beach getaway. Recommend bringing or renting s bike - bike path along the coast is awesome!"
215161,140961552,2017-04-01,58166574,Anna,"We stayed at this place for one week during our holidays. Thomasina sent us all needed information upfront and was replying very quickly to our requests. From the Airbnb it's just a few steps to the beach, which was awesome. Also walking to Washington Blvd with a lot of restaurants and a small market is just a few minutes away.<br/>We also used the washing machine and dryer once which was very useful to have. The surrounding is very quiet.<br/>We had a great time there!"

Thomasina made sure we had everything we needed and was quick to answer any questions we had. We would definitely come back!"
8021,361077,2011-07-08,142222,Lizanne,"Sherree is a funny, smart, and interesting person, with lots of ties to the entertainment industry and stories to tell, and she made me feel immediately comfortable in her wonderful home.  She knows and loves her city, and was a great resource for someone unfamiliar with the area.  After one of her famous margaritas sitting outside in her garden, we were having so much fun talking that we ended up having dinner together at one of her favorite neighborhood Italian restaurants that a tourist would be unlikely to find on their own.  Awesome coffee and her homemade cobbler were waiting the next morning. Sherree's home is a stunning, spacious full-floor flat that feels like a movie set from Hollywood's golden age, and is located in a beautiful Beverly Hills neighborhood where I was able to ride my bicycle or walk in any direction to find worthwhile sights, restaurants, and experiences. Sherree's adorable spaniel Buddy is a quiet, obedient, and cuddly companion. I look forward to when I can make another trip to the area and stay with Sherree again."
8021,427578,2011-08-08,2457090,Joy,"I absolutely loved Sherree's space.  Very comfortable, clean and convenient to where my conference was located at.  The bus ride was easy to get to Century City.  I felt safe in the neighborhood. I felt spoilt.  I felt good.  Sherree is a friendly and hospitable host.  Very generous and has a big heart.  I would go back and stay with Sherree again if I were to visit LA again."
8021,451059,2011-08-16,891079,Ronny,"Oh I dont know where to begin. Sherree is the most wondeful host! The location was great and the room was even better than the discription: But it was Sherree (and her wonderful dog Buddy) who made my stay there a five star experience. She made med breakfast, took time to talk and hang out with me and she even gave me lift to my next accomodation. Still I had a lot of privacy in my room with my own bathroom. I would recomend Sherree in a heartbeat and will definately go back and stay at her place. Super!"
8021,462772,2011-08-21,835245,Dominique,What a great and beautifully decorated appartment! Location is perfect and easy to park. Sherree is very easy going and friendly with great respect for her guests privacy.

The place is beautiful and the room is comfortable. Her dog is very friendly and cute (though you do have to be careful not to leave food within his reach!)"
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>In terms of getting around,our experience is a little unusual in that we didn't have a car. Getting to the bus from Sherree's house was no problem,and the walk to such places as The Grove,the La Brea tar pits,the Beverly Center mall,etc was pleasant. Getting to the beach was easy via the express 720 bus on Wilshire.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Sherree was a great host also. The breakfasts she made were delicious (and also different every day!!) and she did a lot of work helping us find things to do also. She recommended a hike that turned out to be amazing,"one of the highlights of our trip. \"",,,,

My niece who lives in Santa Monica couldn't believe our great find. Thomasina and Steve were there for us but not all over us. The place had so many pluses that were unexpected. Plan to tell all my friends. What a great vacation location. We got lucky with a parking spot and that would be the only wish - for a designated spot but it worked out and we got great advice from Thomasina and Steve.

The living room is sizable; big, full kitchen; quiet entry/walkway behind a hedge off the street (doesn’t feel close to the street); less than 2 blocks from the beach; walking distance to a few restaurants; and a short bike ride to the center of Venice Beach. There’s an AC unit in the bedroom (though it’s a little loud). Be sure to sign the guest book! :)"
215161,199991301,2017-10-03,148642922,Cindy,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here. Can honestly say it was even better in person than the photos! Thomasina and Steve are excellent hosts with attention to detail and great communication to help us customize our trip. The special touches in the bungalow made it so cozy and comfortable with even wine and treats upon our arrival! The location is perfect in that you can walk to Venice beach, dining, shopping, etc. Would definitely stay here again and highly recommend!"
215161,202025758,2017-10-09,56016628,Rachel,"Look no further than this beautiful apartment!  Even better than the photos, this apartment is located in a great area and feels just like home almost immediately!  We loved it so much we booked in again!  Can't recommend highly enough. Thank you Thomasina and Steve for sharing your lovely home with us. See you again in a few days!"
215161,203858952,2017-10-15,55446926,Christopher,"Thomasina and Steve have a wonderful little bungalow with just enough seclusion for quiet nights, but nightlife and dining are literally steps away. Easy access to the beach and bike trail.  We can't say enough about how perfect our stay was. We met Steve at check in and he went over everything, even showing us his preferred walking route through the neighborhood. We were greeted with music,  some brews, wine and some snacks to get us settled in and a quick tour of the bungalow which was wonderful.  A clean and pretty spacious place that was perfect for our few days in Marina Del Rey. Great value, good location, we would certainly be back."
215161,205261754,2017-10-21,117700336,Charles,The place is great  . Place is friendly Thank you for the welcoming stay .
215161,230694315,2018-01-28,12707079,Kathryn,Due to a broken window I ended up staying in the bungalow next door. #124 and absolutely loved it.  Thomasina was very easy to communicate with.  The bungalow is a short walk to restaurants and Venice Beach.  And set up beautifully.  I’ll definitely be back.
215161,340986936,2018-10-25,5911775,Shawn,Beautiful place and Thomasina was incredible. Very helpful and made sure I had everything I needed. I’ll be back.
215161,342879116,2018-10-29,135697970,Kim,"Immaculate, beautifully decorated home. The home itself was very comfortable (comfy bed, wonderful huge TV, comfy sofa, amazing bathroom, awesome outdoor space) I can’t say enough good things about the quality and comfort of the home but then there were added touches like the wine and goodies upon arrival!! Great coffee maker and even flavored creamer in the frig! Bathroom was well supplied too. All in all the home was great!! We loved how it was so close to the beach, yet still away from the noise of the beach.  We enjoyed walking to Washington local restaurants and shops. Close to airport and the forum. We would love to book again for future vacations!"
215161,347739417,2018-11-11,77893161,Nancy,"Thomasina's bungalow is the sweetest most comfortable spot you can imagine. And she is an amazing host. We don't get to LA that often, but if we do we'll be headed right back to stay here!"
215161,352129280,2018-11-24,223215649,Jonathan,"This home is awesome! Spacious, brand new renovations, all kinds of little touches go way above and beyond (lighting options, smart TV, jacuzzi tub, bright and breezy). Thomasina was so kind and welcoming. Couldn’t recommend higher"
215161,355557837,2018-12-04,5911775,Shawn,"This was my second stay here. I love how close it is to the beach. The place is incredibly clean and Thomasina is a fantastic host, responding quickly and addressing anything we may have needed. I'll be back!"

215161,359971140,2018-12-18,67091442,Kerenne,"My husband and I loved Thomasina's place! It was so beautiful, stylish, and clean- truly one of the highlights of our trip. The location was also perfect! Thomasina herself was an amazing host. She was so sweet and helpful to us upon arrival and gave us great local tips and recommendations. She added such thoughtful touches to the place which made our experience so much better. For example, she left us wine upon checking in. We were worried about parking but there was street parking pretty close to the place. We highly recommend staying here. We're definitely staying here again next time we're in Venice."
215161,369217408,2019-01-09,43284752,Susan,"Some things stay the same: the great location to easily walk to the beach, walk out to the end of the pier, walk to Washington Bl and Abbott Kinney restaurants, walk to the Venice Canals and to the jetty, to Starbucks or Cow’s End, to Santa Monica and the still crazy Boardwalk. We watched the spectacular fireworks display at the Marina jetty on New Year’s Eve. And had the wonderful weather and radiant sunsets we always expect the first week of January. If scooters or bikes are your thing, there are plenty to rent.<br/>Our lovely and kind hosts are as hospitable as ever with wine, snacks and fresh flowers upon our arrival for our 9-day stay.<br/>What has changed is the unit itself. Fully renovated and redecorated now with top-of-the-line appliances in the beautiful kitchen, a spa-style bathroom, and romantic bedroom. <br/>This was our third stay with Thomasina. Enjoy!"

It was clean, modern, and had everything we needed to kick back and forget about the world outside. It's situated very close to shopping and we even found a park nearby to spend the afternoon reading. Great getaway spot, highly recommended! Thank you!"
67089,2444808,2012-09-29,485037,Deanna,"This was the second time staying at Brenna and Charlie's Bungalow and it was just great. Perfect for what I need: A nice relaxing place with a great kitchen to cook. The place is super cool, very clean and really comfortable. Brenna and Charlie and the kiddos are quite nice and definitely respectful of privacy as well. Will definitely stay here again when I return. Highly recommended!"
8021,875327,2012-01-21,1579716,Melissa,"Sherree was an amazing host from the moment we arrived until the moment we left! She is the walking bible of what to do, where to go, and what to eat. Anything from restaurants to night clubs to shows.  We really enjoyed hearing her high energy stories as well as sharing her amazing breakfasts that she kindly made for us.  She truly is a host that goes above and beyond and my husband and I could not say enough nice things about her and her home.  The house was charming, bright, cheerful, and came with two sweet puppies, Buddy and Hazel.  The location was safe, convenient, and had a friendly neighborhood feel. We only wish we could have stayed longer!"
8021,891425,2012-01-30,1594750,Joanne,"I booked AirBnB for a friend traveling from Korea. Sherree's home was charming, cozy, and she was an incredible hostess! Not only did Sherree take care of every need, but she gathered a delightful and insightful group of her personal friends and invited us back for dinner days after check out. What wonderful stay! We'll be seeing you again soon! Thank you Sherree!"
8021,908814,2012-02-08,1310451,Carli,A lovely place in a great location. Sherree was warm and welcoming and very helpfull with advice on LA. I would definitely recommend this place!

"<br/>\"",,,,,
8021,1286343,2012-05-15,2248446,Leonard,"Sherree was such a wonderful host. It was like staying at an old friend's house and yet we'd never met before. The breakfasts were delicious. The room and adjoining private bath was all I could ask for. The neighborhood is lovely and the backyard makes one feel like you home away from home. Plus her dogs, Buddy and Hazel, are sweet and charming. Most of all is Sherree's easy-going spirit and hospitality. This is a real find."
8021,1338625,2012-05-23,1275089,Stacey,"Sherree was a wonderful breath of fresh air on a whirlwind trip. She was accomodating and a pleasure to communicate with throughtout the entire process. Curteous, fun and accessible when I needed anything. The room was serene, very comfortable and well put together. I enjoyed relaxing in ithe sun in the outdoor seating area, her many LA publications and was lucky enough to experience the taste of her famous margarita recipe :) I would not hesitate to stay with Sherree again. It was a treat to cross paths with this gem and her lovely home."
8021,1376577,2012-05-29,2277333,Valerie,"Sherree's place was perfect for our stay in LA and she had plenty of magazines, guides and suggestions for touring the LA area. Our room and bathroom where clean, comfy and cozy. It was really exciting when she suggested we go to the SLS Hotel/bar to have a drink and we ran into an NFL star who bought our drinks and entertained us with his conversation. Last but but not least her dog buddy stole our hearts. She was a great host and I highly suggest her home for your stay in LA."
8021,1679068,2012-07-10,1885894,Sharyn,"What can you say about a stay with Sherree?  She really is the hostess with the most-est.  From the moment I arrived until the moment I left, I felt as if I had known her forever.  Her home is your home for your time there.  I was lonely being away from my dog for 2 weeks, but her furry friends Buddy and Hazel treated me like family and helped me deal with missing my pooch.  If you want private time.. .you have it.  If you want company. . .you can have it too.  She has more gadgets and other kitchen accessories to make cooking a breeze.  And you cannot be more centrally located.  Downtown, the beach, the airport. . .you really are never too far away.  And she has quite the knack for avoiding traffic in the area. . . she always gave me great directions avoiding the freeways and therefore usually avoiding traffic."
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>I HIGHLY recommend a stay at Sherree's . . . as a matter of fact. . I will be back there in a few weeks when I return to LA. . . we have to finish our Mad Men Marathon.  Thanks again for everything!!!\"",,,,,
8021,1719414,2012-07-16,2384708,Leila,"Sherree was a great hostess! She made us feel welcome right off the bat for our first trip to LA. Her home is beautifully decorated and lovely to just sit back and relax in. Love, love, love the back patio with the comfy furniture and umbrella to keep you cool. The bedroom was private and breezy and you had your own bathroom."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>She has two adorable dogs that were fun to play with and enjoy. We had breakfast tortillas one morning with bacon and awesome French toast the next morning.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The location is central to several LA hotspots like Hollywood blvd.,Sunset,Melrose,wilshire,"rodeo drive and is a short drive to venice beach and Santa Monica and its nice shopping district. Sherree knew so much about the area which was very helpful not knowing much about the city. Parking at her house was really easy too! Would definitely stay with her again!\"",
8021,1849094,2012-07-31,2486130,Nancy,"Sherree is, without a doubt, the consummate hostess.  Her personality exudes warmth, caring and fun; she is not your stereotypical innkeeper.  She always goes above and beyond to meet the individual needs of her guests.  To say she wears many hats would be a gross understatement--chef, tour guide, chauffeur, caregiver, entertainer..."
<br/>I think the best way to describe my experience at Sherree's house is to simply say that it was the closest thing to being home.,,,,,

The bungalow is exactly like the pictures (perhaps even better in person) and their garden is beautiful. Its also very close to the downtown Culver City area and freeways. Thanks again for making us feel at home!
67089,2591980,2012-10-12,3768813,Katie,"My family and i had to find a temporary rental while fumigating, and Brenna and Charlie's Bungalow was the perfect home away from home. Not only is the place cozy and beautiful decorated, Brenna and Charlie were incredible hosts. Our kids played together while i cooked dinner with veggies and herbs from Brenna garden, then later ate around the fire pit and topped it all off with an evening dip in the spa. This truly felt like a stay-cation! We will surely be back!"

We arrived at 1 a.m. due to delays in our flight and at the car rental office, and were able to enter the bungalow without a problem.  They have thought of everything - the bungalow is beautifully decorated and very comfortable!!  Access to an outdoor grill, fire pit and seating area were a bonus :-)  The house is in a quiet neighborhood with plenty of street parking and easy access to Santa Monica (where we were visiting family).  Brenna and Charlie also respected our privacy while also being accessible to us if we had any questions.  We had a truly wonderful stay here and will definitely recommend this bungalow to our friends!  We're looking forward to our next visit back!"

My husband and I decided to drive down to LA for a last minute trip and were fortunate enough to book Brenna's bungalow for the weekend. I can't express in words how fantastic the unit is. The design is modern and stylish, the apartment was spotless and the little details (welcome basket, book of menus, etc.) were unbelievably thoughtful. We are originally from LA so we knew the area well. The bungalow is situated in a quiet neighborhood in Culver City, but about 5 minutes away from the city's downtown area. I would book here again in a heartbeat!"
67089,2865395,2012-11-12,3885239,David,"Brenna's bungalow was great fun. It's within walking distance of downtown Culver City, a cool city within a city, and the Sony Pictures Studio, which we toured while there. I enjoyed walking the tree-lined streets in the early morning. Many good restaurants in the small downtown area of Culver City and  on Washington Blvd. At night we enjoyed the hot tub and the fire pit. I tried to limit time on the big 3D TV that comes with a killer assortment of DVDs. Nice kitchen, great shower. No complaints at all."

My favorite thing about Brenna is that she is so quick with getting back to any emails. Plus she always kept me informed on her schedule the day of our arrival. The actual Bungalow is amazing. It is so modern, which i love, but also feel very warm and almost like my own home. If your coming to culver city or LA in general, this is the place you must stay at."
67089,3124367,2012-12-20,3586799,Lisa,"This is the most well thought-out airbnb stays we have ever had. From the welcome bowl of nuts, chocolate and fruit that Brenna left out for us, to the printed out menus and restaurant suggestions in the guest binder upon arrival. Since it was cold out, we really appreciated having the electric fireplace in the bedroom and it heated the bungalow very thoroughly. Brenna & Charlie were lovely hosts, quick to respond and so easy to get along with. Since my husband and I work remotely, we loved pulling all the doors open in the bungalow and having indoor/outdoor space and enjoyed the sound of the fountain. The BBQ, hot tub, fire pit and lounge area were such bonuses. We also had no problem finding parking on the street and felt very safe in the neighbourhood. We would definitely stay here again and would recommend this rental to others."

She even picked us up from the airport and gave us a mini tour of the area. <br/>Thomasina never took more than 10 minutes to respond to our questions and needs throughout the stay. There was a hiccup with the gas company coming by and turning off our gas. Apparently the plumber did the work wrong so it needed to be fix. What we thought was a huge inconvenience, Thomasina was quick to contact her friend who owned an Airbnb nearby to allow us to shower at his place so we would be on time for my birthday dinner reservation."

The bungalow was beautiful, bright and classy! Lots of natural light, nice design and fixtures and a comfy sofa! It appears small from the street, but OMG does it feel so spacious and open! The place has a super modern beach vibe and the location is just a few minutes walk to Venice Boardwalk and a 20 min Bike ride to Santa Monica pier. The beach is literally 4 blocks away (if that)! All of the amenities of home made this place FEEL like our home. We love this place, and didn't want to leave. Highly Recommend! Thanks Thomasina and great work!  Can't wait to come back!"

First of all the location was something that we thought about a lot because even though we wanted to head south as far as laguna beach we didn’t want to be very far from the airport, so we were looking for somewhat of a central location, and this place fit the bill. Its about a 20 min drive without any traffic and it a 2 min walk about from Venice beach and the walkway that goes up and down the beach. Every morning we were able to get up and explore Venice a little bit while finding a cafe and figuring out what we wanted to do for that day. We rented a car which I think is very important so that you can see the whole city of LA and not just Venice. But if you happen to not have a rented car you can always rent a electric scooter or bicycle right on main strip and that will get you anywhere in Los Angeles proper that you need to go. The actual apartment itself was very clean and Newley renovated which made it seem much better than the pictures, even though the pictures looked great. Everything in the apartment worked fine like the coffee maker, laundry, dishwasher and fridge. There were more than enough blankets and towels in the apartment. Thomasina also was so nice and gave us a bottle of wine and had some coffee creamer and beans in the apartment for us before we arrived. My wife I headed to laguna and Newport Beach on the middle of the week and had some amazing food at spots like “Malibu farm” and “Sabatinos” and really enjoyed the more relaxed feel. We had food and drinks  in west Beverly Hills at “SUR” “PUMP”, “Dan tanas”, “Craig’s” and “Mastros”. All amazing food. On our last day we drove about 40 min north to Santa Monica and Malibu on the route 1, and had the most amazing meal of my life at a restaurant in Malibu called “Nobu”. <br/>All in all amazing trip and an amazing place. Don’t miss out of this awesome gem in DOGToWN!!<br/>Thanks so much<br/>Matt"

No problem parking and was great not having to pay additional fees to park. Comfortable and welcoming stay in this beautiful house.  Would definately use airnb again and look forward to staying with Sherree on our next west coast trip.

8021,2802941,2012-11-04,3793736,Sally,My husband and I spent two nights at Sherree's delightful home in November. The room and the house are as per the photos - amazing. Sherree is the consummate host; she knows how to respond to an extremely jet lagged traveller vs one who has had a good nights sleep! The location is as central as you can get in a place like LA. We walked or took the bus to all the places we wanted to visit.
8021,2836686,2012-11-07,4032987,Stefania,"\"My husband and I stayed at Sherree's place during our road trip. We had a wonderful time here. Our schedule was pretty packed and Sherree was very flexible with us. Her place gave us that \"\" stop and smell the roses\"\" kinda feeling especially in the mornings for coffee when sat in the back yard. A absolutely cush and laid back experience! Her place is extremely clean and full of character. Loved your decorations!!! The doggies cute as heck"
<br/>Sherree you're a beautiful and interesting person to meet in life!,,,,,
"<br/>Would love to stay here again the next time we're in town.\"",,,,,
8021,3234389,2013-01-02,967460,Neil & Marjan,"Sherree was the most wonderful host with the two most adorable dogs! Her house is very clean and exactly as advertised, in a nice quiet area. From her house LA was very accessible to all major sights and places and Sherree was also very hospitable and helpful and managed to recommend us a place to go for dinner for almost every night we stayed there plus for New Year's Eve. An excellent place to stay and definitely we would be staying there again if we were to visit LA again! And Sherree next time we will take the dogs with us to Europe ;)"
8021,3402128,2013-01-23,321976,Elena,My stay was amazing!!! Sheree is a great host and we became friends. I felt like it was my home.
<br/>Sheree is in a healthy life style;  she cooked yummy breakfast for me and invited me for drinks and dinners a few times.,,,,,
<br/>She just loves to cook and she is very good at it. I got some recipes!!,,,,,
<br/>  I felt that I was renting the whole floor - living room,with the real beautiful fireplace,dining,a den,a kitchen and a garden. Because any time I wanted to use the space it was there for me.,
<br/>The place is very special,beautifully designed,moldings,many details,and candles.  Many flowers. The firewood was always available.,
<br/>We watched and discussed movies,shared laugh and stories.,,,,
<br/>We also went to Caravaggio and Kubrick exhibits at LACMA.,,,,,
<br/>The bed was perfect,many different soaps in the bathroom,the room was cleaned twice a week,a lot of closet space,a desk,no problem fast speed internet
<br/>And the location!!   If one wants to walk - 25 min walk to Rodeo Drive shops,20 min walk to fancy restaurants,or 5 min walk to a very cool Robertson Blvd. with fashion stores,yoga,and Chinese tea spots. 5 min drive to the Groove,the Market
<br/>And the dogs are the cutest and smartest I ever met.,,,,,
<br/>I will stay at Sherry's again and recommend everyone to stay there. I actually cannot wait to come back.,,,,,

215161,457278719,2019-05-23,22436003,Vince,If you own an Airbnb I suggest you spend a night here and experience how a guest should be treated. The Gold standard right here.
215161,459643485,2019-05-27,258033586,Edward,"This place has tremendous value for a trip to California. You can ride bikes or a scooter down the boardwalk to Santa Monica pier faster than you can take an Uber. 1 minute walk to the beach. Rides into Hollywood and to and from the airport were totally reasonable. Just make sure your traffic timing is considered. LA is the fastest Uber pick-up city I have ever experienced. Not having to bring keys with us was probably my favorite touch, one less thing to worry about. Highly recommend and will definitely stay here again if we get the chance. So much fun."

Perfect neighborhood - 4min walk to the Venice Pier or the beach!<br/>The place is extremely clean and modern, in a quiet street with plenty of free parking options!<br/>Thomasina and her hubby are both very friendly and helpful, I can honestly say that this has been one of my best Airbnb stay ever!"
8021,3635876,2013-02-26,2353140,Harry,Sherree was a model host. Full of local knowledge and lots of fun to be with. The room was beautifully decorated with the convenience of having an en-suite bathroom. Sheree's place was also perfectly located in LA with all tourist type destinations within reach.

215161,469496169,2019-06-14,4740946,Amanda,Tidy cute spot in a great location! Was an easy place to stay for a work trip. Thomasina was super helpful and responsive.
215161,472048239,2019-06-18,127433630,Ardys,I was greeted by Thomasina and she was so warm and lovely and made me feel immediately welcome. She showed me her beautiful bungalow and helped me get sorted out. <br/>The location is perfect!!! Walking distance to Venice blvd and the beach. It’s located on a quiet side street and I never felt un safe or was awoken by street noise. <br/>The bungalow is exactly as pictured. Super comfy king bed and large jetted bath. <br/>It’s my new home away from home!!!!

215161,491108942,2019-07-19,17662790,Tiffany,"This place is truly special. As thankful as I am to Thomasina and Steve, I'm almost equally grateful to the travelers who came before us for taking such good care of what they obviously felt was a special place, as well. It feels absolutely brand new.<br/>I'll be honest, when I read all the reviews about how great the hosts were, I was a little worried because I value my privacy and worried that the hosts would be around a lot. I needn't have worried. They were around a bit because they personally tend to the properties and could not have been more wonderful- saying hello when we were heading out and offering a perfect Taco Tuesday tip that turned into a fantastic taco party for us and our friends who were staying nearby. It didn't at all feel like a bed & breakfast-type host. Just incredible people who care about their wonderful property and are always updating more and more. Nothing in this place is permitted to get old, or even old-ish.<br/>They truly put so much thought into this place. We were blown away by how everything just feels right. It's not a huge space, but it feels big and the clean lines and nice touches make it so relaxing. There were days we just stayed in the bungalow for hours rather than going out because it was so chill. I want to put the sofa and tub in my own home. Everything, and I mean EVERYTHING, we needed was waiting there for us. You could honestly show up with your clothes and toothbrush and need for nothing.<br/>The location is fantastic- soooo close to the beach and a quick walk to the restaurants on Washington. I could go on and on, but really we were just so happy that the place was almost too good to be true. This is where I want to retire. But, before that, we want to come back again and again."
215161,494661668,2019-07-24,57336059,Jamie,This home is amazing. I loved the style and it’s in a great location! Close to the beach and the nightlife. Thomasina and Steve were excellent hosts. If I had any questions they were quick to respond. I can’t wait to come back next year!
215161,497790745,2019-07-28,63611496,John Joachim,"Hard to describe how amazing this place is. Just read the other reviews - it's a gem. The location is perfect, the space is even better than the pictures, amenities are better than hotels, and Thomasina is amazing. Would give 6 stars if possible!"
215161,503915643,2019-08-06,118386135,Nicole,"Parking was difficult in the area, but other than that my stay was fantastic. The place was spotless, newly renovated, great location. And Thomasina was very accommodating and quick to respond. Great location as well, right next to the beach and quick walk to Abbot Kinney Blvd."

215161,536960784,2019-09-27,23577879,Rob,"Great apartment. Very tidy!  Nice touch with wine and coffee.  <br/>Beware though of the bed.  Very high quality to be sure, but it has a “pillow top” that made the bed way too soft for me.. I actually had to sleep on the couch! (nice and firm!)"
67089,3354476,2013-01-15,421048,Jeffrey,"Wow.  Great place, exactly as advertised.  Excellent hosts, great communication and perfect location.  I'll be back!"
67089,3368168,2013-01-18,4597871,Joel,"As close to perfect as hospitality gets. This was our first AirBnB experience, and I can only hope that future ones are as all as smooth and seamless as this one.  The bungalow feels like home, clean bright and beautifully designed, with quiet, pleasant outdoor seating, grill & hot tub.  Hard to get a feel from the photos how comfortable it all is.  Brenna is a perfect hostess who is both warm and professional, and makes you feel like the place is your own."
8021,4685069,2013-05-20,2754827,Emily,Sherree was the perfect host.  She checked in to see what kind of breakfast my new employee (who was the guest) liked to have on hand the day before the stay began.  The place was beautiful and comfortable and Christina (the guest) raved about how beautiful the place was.  I highly recommend staying here!
8021,5197665,2013-06-17,2924529,Thomas,"Es war unsere erste Erfahrung mit Air BnB, aber sicher nicht die letzte. Sherree war einfach nur eine großartige, sehr zuvorkommende Gastgeberin, in einer fantastischen Gegend in L.A. Sie gab uns das Gefühl, sich in ihrem Zuhause wohl zu fühlen. Sollten wir wieder nach L.A. kommen, Sherree wäre unsere erste Wahl."
8021,5566242,2013-07-06,6834139,Natalie,"Sherree is lovely bubbly lady and a most welcoming host! Throughout my stay Sherree asked if she could do anything for me and to never hesitate to ask. The room and apartment felt like a home from home while I stayed. The room is furnished in great taste with plenty of amenities in the bathroom. Sherree offered breakfast daily and although I didn't take her up on her kind offer, I felt like a welcomed guest to grab a bowl of cereal or a banana to go. The location is a lovely, safe neighbourhood. Thanks for a warm welcome and more than pleasant stay Sherree!"
67089,3393521,2013-01-22,807749,Ray,Brenna has created a beautiful and comfortable space for  one two or perhaps even three people. The outdoor space that is shared with them was lovely. We had great weather but since we were seeing our grandchildren had too little time to use it. Brenna and her husband were great hosts. We had no problems. Everything we needed had been thoughtfully provided.
67089,3425570,2013-01-28,4297428,Letícia,"It was definitely the best place I've stayed during my trip. Brenna and Charlie were PERFECT hosts, very helpful, and the bungalow was better than i thought it would be. It is a wonderful and special place that you will fall in love with after staying here for a night. Very clean, very well located, spacious, comfortable and it has everything you need. I would definitely stay at this property again, seriously. Brenna, congratulations on your beautiful bungalow and lovely family, I hope we can come back soon."

Very comfortable bed and a nice sitting area in the yard. We spent a week here and would definitely stay again if we come back to California."

The house is better than the photos, in a very safe area, and convenient to everything.  The beach is literally a 5 minute walk away.  I went running along the beautiful nearby canals, biking on Venice Beach and shopping and to the beach.  The living space is beautiful, all seemingly brand new and spotless.  Very comfy bed, great jacuzzi<br/>and shower.  I sat out in the little patio area.  It's very quiet also.  I will be returning."
215161,545647947,2019-10-12,28511169,Jen,"We had a wonderful stay at Thomasina’s charming bungalow. We would stay there again and would recommend it without hesitation. Thomasina was very helpful prior to our arrival and was very responsive to all of our questions. Her husband, Steve, met us at the property to show us around and responded right away when we had a minor issue with the coffee grinder (he brought us a new one the next morning). The bungalow was SPOTLESS. Thomasina and Steve had left coffee for us and provided a generous amount of creamers and condiments, which we much appreciated. The bed was extra comfortable, as was the furniture, which we lounged on gratefully. And the kitchen had everything we needed. Oh, yes—the bathroom was enormous, with a jetted tub, which I took advantage of. And the washer/dryer came in handy. The bungalow was beautiful throughout. We truly felt at home. <br/>The property is within walking distance to the beach (5 minutes) and tons of restaurants (5 to 10 minutes). We used the beach chairs provided (we were very thankful for these) and recommend C&O Trattoria for dinner (we also ordered from their sister restaurant, C&O Cucina, because they delivered) – very yummy and they had gluten-free options too. The beach was beautiful, clean, and virtually empty. <br/>Thank you, Thomasina and Steve! We look forward to our next visit."

O apto é espaçoso, ilumniado e muito bem equipado. O banheiro é grande e confortável e a localização é bastante boa.  Impressionante o silencio a noite, um bom lugar para uma boa noite de sono.

I was working a hard  schedule, but there was freshly made coffee (nice french press coffee, not a drip machine) waiting for me no matter how early I was heading to work. Added bonus is that the dogs are friendly and fun, kept me company while I worked on my laptop in the courtyard. Would stay again, great location."

The room is great and the house is so beautiful, it comes straight out of a magazine. The location is ideal to Hollywood, Beverly Hills and surrounding area. Close to so many things in a nice, quiet neighborhood.  Sherree was incredible, a smart and funny lady. She is a thoughtful host who provides everything you'd ever need - including lots of useful information on the area and she is always extremely responsive to any inquires. She provided a nice breakfast and made sure all my needs were met. I miss our morning conversations. The two dogs Buddy and Hazel are sweethearts."

Lovely home with lots of colour and great furnishings, we felt very relaxed and comfortable, whether it was having a lie-down in our bedroom or enjoying breakfast in the sun room. Sherree could not have been more hospitable - we woke up to fresh fruit salad and coffee each morning, and she was very helpful with advice on what to do in LA and was a fun and insightful person to chat to.

This spot is better than the pictures and fully equipped with everything you need and more. Brenna and her family were so gracious and provided a plethora of information to get around the city. The location is great and was very easy to get to Hollywood, Beverly Hills, and only 10 mins from LAX. Close to several restaurants and things to do. If I'm ever back in LA I will definitely be staying here again!"

<br/>Brenna is the epitome of hospitality: justly proud of her bungalow,available for anything that comes up,and respectful of your privacy throughout. This is a beautiful place,entirely by design. And it shows.,,

My first day of shopping set me up for my 6 day stay.  Everything was so close in Cukver city ... even LA! The bungalow had everything ... even complimentary coffee! It was just as I had expected and after nearly a week, my second home!  On street parking was great and always a free spot."
<br/>,,,,,

The location was perfect, easy (and cushy) access to everything.  Sherree is one of a kind!  Loads of personality and a gracious host; also, she makes a lovely breakfast.  Love her adorable dogs too.  The home is lovely and unique.  I will stay again and recommend."

<br/>I had a very warm welcome after long 22 hour journey from Russia to LA. Sherree sent me a message after my arrival and was waiting for me at home with a cool glass of nice vine. She showed me her house and I felt very comfortable from the first minute. Moreover I wanted to sleep in a day because of 12-hour time difference. But Sherree helped me stay awake by going out to dinner. I went to bed in a right LA time!,,,,,
<br/>Of course,I want to say some words about Sherree’s house. The whole house was nicely decorated. Sherree has a great taste in interior design!  My room was beautifully furnished. It was really spacious and light. The bed was super comfortable,I slept like a new born baby.  The room had a separate bathroom. Everything was very,very clean! There was everything I needed: shampoo,body wash,soaps
<br/>I didn’t take car during my stay however there was always plenty of parking and an extra space by Sherree's garage if it ever gets busy during street cleaning.,,,,,
<br/>The place was really conveniently located. I could easily reach all interesting places in LA. It was really right in the center of LA! The neighborhood was safe and quiet. I was travelling alone and I felt very safe even coming back home at night.,,,,,
<br/>I really felt very comfortable with Sherree. She has a nice personality and I liked to chat with her in the mornings during breakfast and I enjoyed her company talking near the fireplace in the evenings. I could relax in my room if I needed some privacy. Sherree and I celebrated my birthday together.  She took me to a wide range of cool new bars and restaurants all around West Hollywood & Beverly Hills.  Some great Gastropubs. I can say that it was unforgettable and very fun birthday!,,,,,
<br/>It was my first time in Los Angeles so Sherree gave me personalized maps and interesting sites all over town,helping me plan each day over a delicious breakfast.  Like having a personal concierge. She knows city like the back of her hand and she advised me many places where only locals go. When I missed a flight to Vegas,Sherree navigated getting me refunds from other hotels and flights. She really tried to make my stay in LA extremely comfortable,interesting and unforgettable!,,
<br/>Sherree also loves to cook and I enjoyed fantastic breakfast every morning! Fresh coffee was always waiting for me when I woke up. And Sherree tried to cook something new every morning! She also recommended me some great restaurants and bars,some of them were located not far from Sherree’s home.,,,,
<br/>It was really like staying at friend’s home. Fantastic experience! I will definitely stay at Sherree’s house next time and I recommend it to everybody!,,,,,

I woke up to French pressed coffee waiting for me on a beautiful napkin each morning.  Sherree's dogs are sweet, loving and fun.  I can't say enough wonderful things about Sherree.  I would definitely stay in the suite again.  Next time I promise to bring less food.  Sherree didn't complain when I unpacked three bags of groceries the first night I arrived at her doorstep...late at night.  She smiled and said, \"\"I can make room.\"\"  \""

Sherree's home is a lovely example of '20s L.A. domestic architecture, beautifully complemented and enhanced by her furnishings. Her two rescue dogs are extremely well behaved and endearing. But by far the best thing about staying with Sherree is Sherree herself. She is wonderfully generous with her time, her food and drink, and local knowledge. And she is fantastic company - very smart and hilariously funny. Thanks for everything Sherree - including S.Y.D.! - and good luck with your future plans."

I love her two dogs, very friendly and not barkers. There was coffee waiting every morning and several times she had made breakfast for us. Her home is immaculate and beautifully decorated. Our suite and attached bathroom were perfect the bed was very comfortable. On some nights we returned rather late in the evening and even though there may not have been parking in front of her home there was parking one short block away. I'll definitely stay with Sher the next time I am in LA."
217666,713271,2011-11-13,1190502,Eddie,"A great place in a perfect Hollywood location. A home away from home, with your own private address and outside patio.  I can't say enough great things about the hosts. We had a lovely brunch together with their friends before I left and will always remember the jaw dropping interesting conversations. I consider them friends and will return to stay next time I am in LA.  The flat itself is brand new in furniture and electronics with everything you need.  The address is a few blocks away to the most renowned acting schools in LA, and my scene partners found the place perfect for rehersals. Don't hesitate, highly recommended."
217666,1206518,2012-05-01,1315665,Jack,"I took TravelArtist Diva’s Hollywood-Mid-Wilshire-Melrose Apt. for five-and-a-half months in late 2011 and early 2012 (I had an IT consulting contract in town). So this review will be on the long side. My work was located mid-Wilshire. TD’s house was plenty convenient to that. Close enough to walk to work (down Fairfax to Wilshire then west to Crescent Heights) in only about 20 minutes. Actually I realized the apartment was close to work, but far enough away from it so that I could get that invigorating walk to work when I wanted. Othewise, the place is very convenient to L.A.--to other workplaces (such as CBS Studios, Cedars-Sinai), to shopping, to entertainment, etc. Even if you've come to LA to work, as I did, you could wind up taking a good deal of time off—that is, staying home. For that this place has great advantages. It’s central to so much, it makes so many Westside L.A. areas accessible: Hollywood, West Hollywood, Mid-City LA, Beverly Hills, downtown. A perfect location. The closeness of everything from landmarks to a slew of markets and grocery stores makes you feel right at home. You arrive and quickly find everything's within walking distance. Other guests have pointed out it's especially close to a range of showbiz industry acting workshops, film & TV studios, etc. So it's cool if you’re seeking work as an actor, actress, writer. If you're inclined to be in the biz, it's simply very helpful to stay here, short-term or long-term. In my case, just on IT consulting work, I made TD’s place my home for five-and-a-half months. Again, not only the apartment, but the whole surrounding neighborhood. I took advantage of that—the 20 minutes' walk to Wilshire Blvd., with its three Miracle Mile museums--L.A. County Museum (LACMA), the Craft & Folk Art Museum, and the Petersen Automotive Museum (which has its very own embedded version of Johnnie Rockets' ‘50s themed American restaurant). Rockets is just steps away from the Petersen's displays of vehicles old and new, classic and unusual. In fact, the area around the Hollywood-Mid-Wilshire Melrose apt. is so walkable that, my first month there, no slight to Petersen’s, I didn't have a car, because I didn’t need one. And I had no car for the last two months of the stay. Because I just didn't need one. If from time to time I needed one, I could take one from either the Hertz or Enterprise offices nearby--each not more than about six-blocks away. So much of the time, you won't even need transit. But it's there if you really need it. There’s public transit, too. Meantime, there are so many restaurants nearby, including one right down the street from TD's place, Buddha's Belly, one block south; there's even nightlife, the Melrose fashion district (two blocks north), Pink's (you gotta go to Pink's on La Brea for the most shameless weiners and chili fries). Antonios' Mexican food on Melrose is also a classic. So TD’s place is about residential Hollywood, but..."
217666,1384633,2012-05-30,1347028,Mattie,My parents live in England and visit me in L.A. every six months or so – they needed a place to stay for two weeks. I live in the Fairfax District (six blocks from this apt)
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Host was great. Sent email info promptly before,during and after the stay. End of the stay,the host took my parents to the airport at no charge,as I was unavailable – I was so impressed with this generosity.  The host was equally resourceful when,at first,my folks had difficulty logging onto the WiFi network. She came over instantly
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>My folks,in their ‘60s,found the place “absolutely perfect” (Mom’s words). They liked going to the Grove shopping center,also about six blocks away. Went to breakfast there (Marmalade Cafe) several mornings. For other meals,they enjoyed Buddha’s Belly,just down the block. They also liked a classic Italian spot
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>My parents mostly walked places,like to my apartment,15-20 minutes away. Took a cab only once--to Century City on a shopping spree. Once they’d left,a few times,our host managed to insert a fast,skilled maid – the place was immaculate.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The folks enjoyed visiting the Getty Center in Brentwood most of all,- there was a dynamite photography exhibit on. Closer in,pretty much down the block,in Pan Pacific Park,they took in the Holocaust Museum. Dad also patronized a driving range. Also visited Burbank’s Warner Bros. studio museum. And attended two parties,one in Venice
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Angelenos know that the more coastal or elevated areas of  SoCal don’t simmer in summer.  Patio doors opened to a great outdoor area with a dining  area for 4 people.  The apt also had very efficient A/C.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Overall,the host “really looked after every detail,” Dad said,“providing everything.” Amenities include (unlike some nearby places that my girlfriend’s mother,also British,has tried when visiting) - towels and bathrobes to new batteries for the remotes. House also plenty quiet

The owners are really nice and made sure that everything that I could have needed was there, or they made it available to me, they are very quick to respond to any help you may need."
<br/>Great place to stay,I stayed for a month and it was very comfortable,they even brought in a maid to clean up during my stay,which was nice. Nice location,quiet and awesome! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED! STAY HERE! I could also swear I felt like I had the whole house! Never really heard a peep from the neighbors,other than maybe a footstep or two.

217666,1797444,2012-07-25,2457158,Matthew,"I am an Australian musician, living in New York. I had 2 weeks to spend in LA finishing a recording 1.5 years in the making. I must say have spent a lot of time in different hotels while on the road, and generally have lived in a lot of different places during my travels. This is one of the absolute best accommodation experiences I have ever had."
<br/>Myself and my wife/bandmate were finishing a recording in Beachwood canyon (just below the Hollywood sign). We needed somewhere nice,not too expensive,convenient,and preferably somewhere that had a good vibe,which is generally very important to come home to when you're working creatively every day.,
<br/>Travel Artist Diva's place is cosy (not too small though),it's wonderfully lit by natural light,the temperature is always comfortable (I think it's well insulated,I was there in July and never needed more than an overhead fan) and it just has a good feel.,,
<br/>Location is great - I walked to the recording studio in Hollywood each day,and I had plenty of shops,cafes,bars etc all within easy walking distance. On my weekend off I walked ten minutes to the Beverly Theater to see a wonderful old Black and White film - the treasures of the Fairfax district are many-layered and diverse. It's very easy to find something original,creative and fun to do around there and it's not your typical LA neighborhood. This is like Hollywood's ground zero - there's a lot of popular history in those streets.,
<br/>The place was well stocked,well maintained and I felt right at home the whole time. The weekly cleaning service went over the place top to bottom during my stay,which was great.,,,
<br/>I even requested a very late checkout on very short notice (a day before scheduled check out,I asked to leave around 9pm),which was simply no problem at all. Very accommodating.,,,
"<br/>It was very important to me that we picked the right place to stay while we finished our project - this place was a great investment and contributed hugely to our trip being a roaring success. I would recommend it to anyone in a second!\"",,,,,
217666,2079540,2012-08-24,1522469,Alec,This spot was perfect for us- great size for a single or couple. The private deck was such a treat - we ate dinner outside every night.

<br/>In short: perfect location - literally walking distance to the Farmers Market/The Grove,Pan Pacific Park with a clean public pool,tennis courts at Poinsetta and Plummer park,tons of shopping and food options (including an amazing kosher shwarma spot on Melrose).,,

<br/>All kitchen amenities on site for those who like to cook,washer/dryer,great shower/water pressure,movie channels,etc - easy parking.,

The bed was very comfortable, although not a memory foam surface (if that's what one is used to or prefers). Nice feather pillows. Kitchen was totally adequate to our cook-in needs. Great to have washer-dryer, too. We loved the location, walking distance to Pan Pacific Park, Farmers Market, shopping at Whole Foods, CVS, Kmart and Ross. Several great dining options in the orbit, all walking distance -- Animal and Robata Jinya among our faves. Also walking distance to the museum zone -- LACMA, Crafts Museum and more. Head north two blocks and you're in the middle of the hipster Melrose district. Go east on foot to La Brea and Pink's hot dogs, plus lots of design and decor shops south on La Brea. A nice, long loop stroll. You'll need a car to explore further. Unit is very quiet and private. Deck was nice, but it was a bit too chilly during our January stay to use the patio much. Would be perfect on a warm summer day, as it's on east side of building. Bravo, Thanks for creating a great getaway space."

Important stuff like toilet, shower, kitchen etc where all on top condition. Great washer and dryer as well. <br/>Walking to the grove or farmers market for breakfast or lunch is something we really recommend. The park just a few blocks away is also great for work out with an outdoors gym and nice running tracks. The small patio in the front yard was all you need for a nice breakfast in the open. <br/>We really don't have anything negative to say apart from maybe the Internet connection being a bit slow which frustrates us musicians when we can't upload larger files. TD told us this would be fixed within the coming days so I assume it's no longer an issue. <br/>Would definitely recommend this apartment and will live their again if we come to LA in this constellation again."

So central with all the amenities and a lovely private (!) terrace in the front. So great to have a washer and dryer on sight. Little things like great water pressure in the shower and a coffee maker made a big difference. Loved the walk in closet. All in all incredible value for such a great spot. Highly recommended.

Everything we needed  (towels, toiletries, coffee, filtered water etc) was supplied in abundance.<br/>They even had the apartment cleaned mid week during our stay.<br/>A perfect hide away yet close to all the attractions!<br/>"
217666,4871735,2013-05-30,1347028,Mattie,"My parents visited me a 2nd time here in L.A. during May, 2013, staying at TD’s Hollywood-Melrose-Mid-Wilshire apt. This time was even better than the first. The hosts were cool, very plugged into email, the web. They’d newly equipped the place with some very robust Wi-Fi. And new air conditioning. Host offered to take my folks to airport - which was really appreciated. When it came to cleaning, the hosts again arranged for a very fast, skilled maid to leave the place immaculate, without inconveniencing us at all. They were just as capable when the washing machine broke halfway into our stay—they attacked the problem head-on within minutes of our mentioning it, and the appliance was operational within about a day. As before, my parents and I liked going to the nearby Grove shopping center and the Farmer’s Market, only about five-blocks' walk away. Also tried BLD, at Vista and Beverly (three blocks’ walk away). My parents also took in new sites within about five minutes’ drive such as the La Brea Tar Pits, the L.A. County Museum of Art, and the Hollywood Forever Cemetery. Since this apartment lies in both a coastal and elevated area of L.A., conditions were very comfortable. The outdoor area especially, accommodating four or more people for dining. We did wish for a larger teapot--the one provided was single-user, since our hosts have promised a larger one for next time. And, as before, the apartment and our hosts managed to prove themselves totally fitting and convenient. We definitely plan on staying there again when we visit next year!"

We often took evening jogs in the area and sometimes stopped to have small chats with the friendly neighbours. Access to Melrose and the farmers market are so close !!  <br/>Bill was so helpful and attentive to anything we asked. I would definite stay again.

We were greeted personally and with a big friendly smile and a tour of our home away from home which was such a warm welcome. Clean, spacious and we loved having a large kitchen to make some of our meals and laundry right in the house :-) The location was central to everything for both walking and driving to some of the outlying areas. So sightseeing all the hot spots is easy to fit into even a busy schedule. The street is quiet and a relaxing way to end busy days.

Big enough for two early teens to have their \"\"space\"\" from each other and for Mom to catch her breath during downtime. The beds were comfortable. The shower was to die for. Many thoughtful touches were provided for which made our stay there special (extra-soft tissue available as needed"

The location is outstanding: convenient to downtown Culver City and the Metro, which opened up the entire L.A. area for us without having to worry about driving. Brenna and her family are the friendliest ever (great bottle of wine waiting for us). The one less-than-perfect aspect to our visit was that we had the misfortune of visiting during the warmest weather that anyone could remember for that time of the year; we really could have used a window A/C :-))"

<br/>,,,,,
<br/>For anyone who is not familiar with LOS ANGELES,bungalows are very common in here. So please disregard the rant of a previous negative reviewer. The back yard is a  private lovely  little oasis with access to a Jacuzzi and fire pit ( which wasn’t working while we stayed there,but it’s probably back in action by now). As for the space its self,what you see in the pictures is what you get. The space is very comfortable for a couple and a few extras ( kids). There are two TVs on in the living room and one in the bedroom. The living space is light big and airy with surround sound,WIFI access and a Wii! It has the feel of a modern studio with a cozy feel. With the weather getting a little chiller there is a heater in the room ( disguised as a fireplace.) On to the kitchen. It come fully equipped. Needless to say .. I want this kitchen! Coffee maker,fridge
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Culver City has great access to many different restaurants and stores for easy shopping and coffee runs. The bungalow is an ideal distance to Santa Monica  partially because you don’t have to take the high way in order to get to the beach it’s a straight line down Washington AVE.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The cake is the bungalow,icing the neighborhood,and the cherry on top is Brenna,she is a talented Interior Designer who created this Bungalow from scratch.  She is warm,friendly and very accommodating. Trust me you will love this place!! We will be back &lt;3,

The way the bungalow is designed and decorated reminds me of the Element Hotels by Westin. There is also a beautiful old film projector ( that I bet has a rich history) in the living room. The kitchen was well stocked and the bed and futon were comfortable. The bathroom has a rain shower head-that you typically find in luxury hotels.I loved the open and  folding windows/door. The courtyard is lovely as well. One afternoon I sat out on the L-shaped couch and worked on my laptop-enjoying the warmth of the sun, the gentle breeze and the quiet. I had a chance to meet Brenna and the children. Brenna was a great host, available when needed while allowing for more than enough privacy. The home is in a great area in Culver City-on a quiet residential street but walking distance to restaurants and coffee shops and of course Sony studios. This space is a valued gem. If it is available when you are looking-stop looking and BOOK IT!"

I have bad mold allergies and particularly appreciate a place with lots of windows and good air quality, so I loved throwing open the full front of windows and letting the fresh air in. It was also so nice to have an outside area to soak the sun into our clammy East Coast bones. Brenna made everything so easy concerning the stay--great communication, no-nonsense and simple coming and going from the property. We would definitely love to stay here again on our next visit to LA--thanks Brenna!"
67089,11095349,2014-03-20,2704814,Catherine,"We fly in to Los Angeles every month for my sons speech therapy. This was the best airbnb we've stayed at by far. Easy parking. Easy access to get in with a child who has an intellectual disability and has to be in a stroller. No steps. No cobblestone walkways. Easy.<br/>The space itself is a dream. That kitchen is gorgeous. The bed it low to the floor so was great for my son. Lots of storage space in bedroom, a play area for my son right outside the guest house with toys from Brenna's kids available for Max. The kids came over one morning and sat and read books with me and my son. So sweet. I felt safe there at night and it was very quiet, clean, new and aesthetically pleasing. All around great experience. Grateful to find a spot that my son can't easily hurt himself in or get out onto the busy street because it's so secure."

We are from the Los Angeles area and just wanted to get away for a bit, and this is the place we chose from any other choice near us! <br/>Brenna and her family were absolutely great! They were actually celebrating their daughter's birthday that Saturday, and her friends were really nice to us when we walked through the party, offering cake and drinks =)<br/>She is a great host and she was always there to answer any questions. I love that she gave us privacy but we had access to her whenever we needed her.<br/>The place was lovely. Super clean and fun to stay there. Everyone was right about the shower, very cool! =) <br/>This is a place that I would definitely suggest to everyone!<br/>Also, my favorite Banana Cream Pie is from a place called Apple Pan which is quite close to Brenna's place, that was a major plus!! Lol<br/>Loved staying here, you will too!"

The kitchen was well-appointed, as was the 3/4 bathroom.  Even the yard was beautiful and comfortable, with sunny or shady spots to suit your taste.  Brenna was very nice and easy to do business with.  We'll be back again."

The place is very quiet at night and has lots of great sun shine warming it up in the morning (we were in LA during a bit of a cold spell.) The bed was very comfortable and my son who slept on the pull out couch said that was great too. The house was stocked with everything you need to cook but there are lots of great places near by to eat out. We were there for a week on college tours for our son and it was really centrally located in the LA area. We will be back for sure!

The shower was grand... we okies couldn't get over how awesome it was to see real orange trees outside the shower window! The location was excellent... we wouldn't change a thing!

It's new, modern, aesthetically pleasing and comfortable. It takes a LOT to please me when I stay somewhere for travel. And this guest house has it ALL. The cleanliness, the new killer kitchen, the bed is low which is perfect for my 5 year old and I don't worry so much that he's going to fall out of the bed in the middle of the night. The bathroom has a super cool shower with a window that faces some orange trees. My son loves to play in the yard with Brenna's kids. Jump on the small trampoline, ride their little razor scooter, try to hit a ball with their plastic bat and fill up their watering can and water the amazing veggie garden. We love opening the wall up that faces Brenna's house and let the cool air in and sit on their outdoor couch. Brenna's kids are so sweet they always come over to see how Max is doing. They share toys with him and even bought Max a toy when they knew we were coming back. I consider them real friends at this point. And look forward to returning."

Pan America Park is less than a 10 minute walk, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods and Farmer’s Market are about a mile, and LCMA just over a mile away.

The furnishings were of very nice quality and comfort. Some things you can't see in the photos include a writing desk, walk in closet, built-in bookshelf with books, and the washer & dryer.

This kind of host are the kind of people that makes me wanna not use airbnb any more and just book a hotel. The host seemed okay at first. However, on the checkout day, I had to leave at 3am due to early flight schedule and this old man was on guard from 2am checking to see if we would steal or break anything. At 2:30am, while my girlfriend was still sleeping, he wanted to come in and check the room. I told him that my girlfriend is still sleeping so he should wait and he started yelling and shouting at the door to wake my girlfriend up. I felt threatened and told him to stop. However, he wouldn't stop yelling and I had to come inside and wake my girlfriend up so we could get out of there. It was not only uncomfortable and threatening, but it was extremely disrespectful and rude of the creepy old man. I strongly advise whoever is reading this to reconsider staying here.<br/>Now, commenting about the place, the floor was very squeaky and the tv was small and old. Out of the four nights I stayed, I had hard time finding street parking spot on two nights. The iron he had was very old and the bed was too soft, which hurted my back.<br/>Overall, dissatisfied and creeped out, unpleasant and uncomfortable experience. I strongly DO NOT RECOMMEND this place!!"

8021,29923646,2015-04-14,6638530,Abigail,"As a former Los Angeles resident, I wanted to stay in a “real and typical” home rather a sterile hotel, during recuperation from a very painful surgery procedure by a specialized medical center nearby Sher’s home and with that I found the perfect little and authentic “cocoon” at Sher’s. Since I spent the majority of the time resting, icing and eating Instacart-ordered baby food, I found Sher’s suite aka room with adjacent private bathroom to be lovely, personal, and truly delivering what the pictures and description promised. Plenty of extra fresh linen and towels, a nice and firm mattress, plenty of pillows and convenient access to both laundry room and kitchen. Sher allowed me to order my food and she even unpacked my first delivery of milk prior to my arrival, making sure it would not spoil. I admit that both her freezer and fridge were packed, so it was important to give Sher a heads-up regarding my food delivery. While Sher and I did not see much of each other, she would constantly (and discreetly) text me to make sure I was medically all-right and whether I needed her to run errands for me; she even offered to go to the pharmacy for me and provided access to her first-aid kit to alleviate my worst pain without me even asking. When she had friends coming over, she even invited me to join “the other girls”. Both her flat mate and dogs are very friendly: I did not mind their presence, however, I did not wanted them [the dogs] in my room and it was no problem at all to keep them out. Just make sure you keep your door closed at all times, if you don’t want them “visiting”. Sher and I were very clear communicators; me giving her heads-ups about my arrival the moment my plane landed and deliveries coming, etc. and her inquiring whether I needed anything or announcing a party in the evening. I was offered to hang out wherever I pleased, including balcony or patio, yet I decided to rest in my room. I had wifi and even a little desk; the one and only item that I felt that the room was missing was a high enough (office) chair; the one provided was too low for my small frame; for a couple hours it was OK for me to use two pillows to sit comfortably, however, for a true work-horse home office, her desk would have been a bit too small. Sher kindly offered to sit elsewhere in her place, if I needed a high enough chair. In a nutshell, Sher is like a friend of a friend, dog-lover, and “foodie” who gives you as much company as you need, great flexibility and otherwise gives you total privacy in a very lovely color-coordinated apartment that delivers exactly the homey suite, in the flatter area of Beverly Hills, which might be important to know for out-of-town visitors who expect Sher’s street address located in the..."

I loved how the apartment had a washer and dryer; patio, and even coffee. The kitchen was very equipped with dishes, utensils, pots/pans, and more. The queen size bed were comfortable and the pillows were soft. There’s also a coach that turns into two beds (if needed). The WiFi was pretty speedy and having cable was a major plus. Also, as soon as you arrive he’ll give you a parking pass so you can park on the block but read the signs carefully. For instance, on Monday’s during a certain time frame you can’t park and Tuesday’s too. As far as restaurant, the Airbnb is centrally located to a lot of eateries on Melrose Ave that’s only a 10 minute walk or a quick drive. Beverly Hills is very close and the Griffith observatory is only a 15 minute drive for those who like to hike. Bill was very kind, available whenever I needed him, and super courteous. My boyfriend and I, had a great stay and will consider staying with him on our next California trip. Thanks Bill!"
217666,353379795,2018-11-27,125084227,Carla,"Location, location, location!<br/>Bill's place could not be more centrally located - Beverly Dr, Melrose Ave, The Grove, The Farmer's Market, CBS Studios, Beverly Hills, Rodeo Drive, Hollywood Blvd, Bel Air, Hollywood Hills, Brentwood, Westwood, Robertson Blvd, The Beverly Centre, Ralph's, Trader Joe's - this full-sized apartment (which is what it is!) is a mere 5-10 mins drive away from it all. We also drive to Santa Monica and Venice Beach, which were only 35-40 mins away.<br/>Parking was simple and painless with the Visitor's Parking Permit that Bill provided (just make sure you park on the correct side of the street on Mon and Tues for the street cleaning that takes place between 10am-12pm). We were able to get a spot right in front of the apartment, or a couple of doors down, each night. <br/>If driving is not your cup of tea, then not to worry. You will be a short walk away from countless shops and restaurants on Melrose Ave, Beverly Dr and The Grove / Farmer's Market. <br/>The apartment itself is much larger than we expected, and had everything that one could need for a quick or extended visit. We were pleasantly surprised to find a full-sized washer / dryer, refrigerator, walk-in closet and desk / work space in the unit as these are not featured in the photos. <br/>The amenities are clean and work well; the bed was very comfortable and the outdoor patio was lovely when enjoying a read or some breakfast in the California, morning sunshine.<br/>The neighbourhood was safe and quiet, and my mom and I felt very comfortable here.<br/>Bill and Lark were very accommodating for our late check-in / check-out times and are easily accessible should you have any questions or need anything. <br/>I would recommend this place to those wanting to be in the center of it all, with easy access to all of the shopping, sightseeing and dining hotspots. We had a fantastic time and would definitely stay here again during our next LA visit. Overall, great value, amazing location and wonderful apartment. <br/>A+!"
217666,353589124,2018-11-28,227552120,William,"Stayed here for starters due to the monthly discount offered here (in contrast to L.A.’s ballistic long-term rents). My firm’s travel manager had pointed out that the monthly rates can be good. She also had a good previous experience referring people here on a longer-term basis. I learned that the list of those coming before me was pretty deep and varied. The hosts were always warm and welcoming, as I experienced during my stay.<br/>The apartment meets some serious standards for those like me: the monthly discount; an abode and amenities well beyond those described; a host that was very easy to get ahold of (yet perfectly respectful of privacy); the safe, quiet and private surroundings and neighborhood (yet they’re it was so convenient to so many resources, even on foot).<br/>Most of all, I’d say, for the working guest, what's cool is the chance to be on-property in a unit equal to the host’s. Not in a room, group of rooms, guesthouse, cottage in back, or converted pool-house or garage (one tucked inconveniently, say, way up in Westside L.A.'s surrounding hills and mountains--despite some incredible views to be had there).<br/>It's nice that the apt, though larger than pictured, is not any larger. Also not pictured but so helpful: a new IKEA gloss-white desk, with drawers and return, anchoring a laptop-friendly workspace. There’s a full-size washer and dryer in the pantry; a totally private patio off the LR that’s charming; a full hanging closet; and other storage spaces about.<br/>The host, Bill, kindly shared with me that, the more that he can know about a working guest ahead of time, the more likely he can discount a stay of one or more months. I forwarded that comment to the travel manager. It’s why I think I’ll be returning here.<br/>Then again, the place is already well-priced for its convenient proximity to helpful resources (especially restaurants), attractions, and points of interest in L.A. You can find a lot about the location in all the other reviews and I second the message in all of them—that this apartment has a great location, making the place, actually, a very good buy!"
217666,366548125,2019-01-02,57453347,Alex,"This apartment was truly a gem - in a perfect location (walking distance to great restaurants and bars), spacious and clean, and affordable! We had an awesome stay and Bill was great host. He was always very responsive and was nice enough to provide us with a parking placard, while also warning us to keep an eye out for the parking signs! I can't say enough about the perfect location of this apartment - it was on a great neighborhood street that was close to several popular places/areas. We'll definitely be back to stay when  we're in the LA area again!"

High speed internet with a private patio and a working desk, it can be your home office while visiting town.and cable television also available.

217666,435175261,2019-04-09,11859272,Irada,"I am an Airbnb guest since 2014, never ever had problems with host. This time we had problems in communication since the beginning. We finally understand the host is only interested in his business. He likes to have the money but he does not care too much. He did not inform us about maintenance in our unit (we rent an entire apartment) and above the unit in advance. Also I do not like people back and forth from my apartment when my personal belongings are in and nobody has informed me in advance; also I have not to ask you, it should be evident you have to if you have guests in. I booked several months in advance and if we knew we probably did not go. For this and many other reasons concerning the house I would never be this place guest anymore."

Only downside for some may be that it’s not very soundproof within the house, but it didn’t bother us. Efficient communication with host who is very friendly and helpful."

One of the best features was the ability to walk to nearby parks, shops and amenities. Nice neighbourhood too! The host was very accommodating and responded to our messages quickly. I would definitely recommend a stay here."
217666,572483907,2019-12-02,296576687,Cristian,"Positive aspects are the location and parking permit.<br/>In the pictures, the apt looks clean, but in reality the appliances in the kitchen are outdated, with a rusted toaster and coffee machine. When the electric kettle is switched on the fuse blows out. The sink was stained, in the cupboards and draws were dirty.<br/>We stayed there 5 days at the end of November and the temperature in LA was low, hence we needed heating.  On arrival day the apartment was really cold. We asked the host, Travelartist (who introduced himself as Bill, but we don’t know his real name, which is weird) switched on the thermostat using a wire. Apparently is was needed to reset the device.<br/>Note that the kitchen and bathroom have no heating at all (which is not mentioned on Airbnb, otherwise we would not have booked).<br/>The only source of heating is an ancient furnace in the living-room, mounted in a hole in the floor next to the bed. The furnaced stopped working when it reached the temperature set on thermostat, but it didn’t reactivate once the temperature dropped. We tried during the night to reactivate the furnace from the thermostat using the wire Bill gave us. We alerted Bill several times by email and calling him. The second night we had no heating at all and we asked the host to bring us an electric radiator. We could smell gas in the room and we were afraid of the carbon monoxide level. First, Bill mounted another thermostat but it didn’t help. Then he brought in the last night an old radiator that  ran only at low speed and didn’t have enough heating power. <br/>Thus, we slept 5 nights in a cold room and checking every hour  the flame in the furnace as we were afraid of gas leak poisoning. We would have expected the host to refunded a part of  the money for the loss of heating and not offering the services described on Airbnb. However, we didn’t ask for a refund. <br/>Instead, the host offered to reimburse $100 to us provided we refrain the writing a review. He would transfer the money after 2 weeks, when the period for reviews on Airbnb expired.<br/>We believe it’s important that other guests are aware of this experience.<br/>We have pictures that document everything about cleanliness and heating furnace. <br/>Most of the time heating is not needed in LA, so probably this issue was so far not noticed. That said, I would not recommend this apartment."
217666,578092052,2019-12-16,17691457,Fiona,"This place is really lovely! It's in an excellent location where you can walk to lots of great restaurants, Trader Joe's and Wholefoods: a feature not to be underestimated in Los Angeles. The apartment itself is very spacious, a super comfortable bed and couch, as well as a great kitchen and bathroom. I thoroughly recommend this place and would definitely stay here again if I returned to Los Angeles. The hosts are excellent too - very accommodating and great communicators: thank you!"
217666,621483767,2020-03-31,626645,Beth,"We have just finished a three month stay at this airbnb.  Its a gem and is run by the owners which adds to its value. TravelArtist is exceptional in the location and comfort  provided as well as the consistent and timely response of the owners. They are long time Angelenos and seem to truly love the city. That feeling shows in the care taken with the rental and with their consistent attentiveness to guests. We came to experiment  with relocation in Los Angeles  and  were in the apartment for a full three months. As three month visitors we settled in and were quite comfortable.  Visitors in LA for a week or two  would be equally  comfortable. The apartment is in a historical neighborhood filled with lovely older buildings and landscaping.  No high towers , no racing cars at midnight--quiet and kind of serene.<br/>The unit is bright and  sunny, and provided us with much more space then we anticipated. We had full sized appliances, a step in shower, and a fulll sized desk with plenty of room for devices and Wifi of course.  The best for us as long term renters was to step out onto the street for our morning walk to the bus or our afternoon walk , and be greeted by friendly neighbors. This is the place to be if you want to live as an Angeleno and walk to local park or  food stores, to the Grove for a film, or to  enjoy the unique restaurants. Try the bus, subway and light rail system  instead of renting a car. We learned how to quickly get downtown with its historic areas, museums, theaters and music venues like Walt Disney Music Hall. Or for a  day in Santa Monica you can use the same system, and ride the opposite direction. TravelArtist also offers parking if that is needed by you or your guests.<br/>At the end of our third month and shortly before departing, the covid-19 crisis began. We could not return to the places we had enjoyed and come to treasure. Life changed quickly and dramatically. We left reluctantly and with good memories as well as a plan to return to TravelArtist next winter."
217666,633065236,2020-06-28,11444767,Valeska,"We enjoyed our stay in Bill’s apartment. It is beautiful, more spacious than we expected, amazing outdoor space and probably on one of West Hollywood’s prettiest streets. The area is great for little walks to explore the amazing houses and tropical plants. And very close to lots of shops and restaurants."
217666,645332997,2020-08-01,305538858,Brenna,"The location is nice, the parking pass was convenient, and it is a comfortable place to stay. The kitchen is a little small, but certainly workable! There were some aspects of the stay that involved the kinds of things that might have factored into my decision when choosing a place, so I’ll explain those here. <br/>	First, the host informed us about construction on the building after we arrived. This was more frustrating than it would have been in other times, given that we are in the middle of the pandemic and the host knew that the two of us would be working from home. It is certainly possible that if we had complained, this work might have stopped, but we would have preferred to know about this before the stay. Second, three weeks into a four-week stay, the host was somewhat insistent on hiring a cleaning service to come inside after we voiced some hesitancy. Both the host and cleaning person initially entered the apartment with no mask and we were asked to spend the morning on the patio to do zoom meetings and other work. This seemed a bit unnecessary as a health risk and inconvenience. Third, the address provided after booking is not the actual address- this became a complication because that we were not told that this was the case and had valuable work materials sent to the address to arrive right as we would. I haven’t had this experience with other Airbnbs, but maybe it is not uncommon. Finally, when I reached out to the host to see if we could cancel the booking because the summer position for which I was coming to LA went virtual due to the pandemic, the host did not allow me to cancel the booking for a meaningful refund. This was completely within the rights of the host under Airbnb’s policy, but they did have the opportunity to do so and chose not to.<br/>	The hosts seemed concerned about how we enjoyed the place and were communicative, so I don’t mean to suggest the stay was unpleasant, but some judgments made were not what I would have preferred."
217666,659230475,2020-08-31,29699649,Anthony,"Plentiful street parking with permit provided. Great, hip, safe location. Takeout and groceries were steps away. Very quiet, comfortable, pleasant. The place was larger than appears in the listing photos. Host gracious, assured quiet each day and all services, such as quick, reliable Wi-Fi (essential to the remote, virtual work I was doing). Host arranged cleanings and had good COVID-19 habits such as wearing masks, social distancing. Check-in went very smoothly. Had the complete details days ahead. All-around great communication from hosts. Would ask me in person now and then if everything OK in the apt. Really, for all of my stay, it was and everything was fine."
217666,712399713,2020-11-29,133789241,Corey,"Overall this place is great. Definitely one of the best Airbnb’s for your money in LA.  The place is spacious and clean. Had no issues the whole time. You’re in a great walking area and it feels very safe. <br/>Things to be aware of: 1. manager lives on site so if you play music or anything else they will know and possibly reach out to you about the volume level. 2. construction noise may occur sometimes, it wasn’t too bad for us and if you have issues with it reach out to him and hopefully they can delay things. 3. You don’t have access to the router so this was an issue for us when internet would go down we’d have to reach out to him, he usually resolved it quickly and they recently got better internet. 4. Cleaning lady must come every two weeks or so. Always on a weekday during normal work hours. This was inconvenient for us as we worked from home but it was nice to have a clean place. 5.  You won’t get the real address to the place until you’re there and when you do he won’t write the actual numbers, this seems weird but he doesn’t want people using the address too much. Understand that they get junk mail from previous renters so it makes sense, just inconvenient. <br/>Like i said, it is still a great place to rent if you can handle these minor inconveniences"

The private covered patio was one of our favorite things about the place. The apartment had plenty of space and storage. The host, Bill, does live on site and is extremely kind and accommodating. They were doing renovations on the connecting duplex during the permissible hours given by LA county for most of the time we were here. It didn’t bother us at all. We would definitely stay here again."

Thanks to the super convenient location, we were able to walk to all the cool places where parking was not so cool, like Melrose and La Brea! There was always street parking at the house, and even with our mediocre parallel parking skills it was always pretty easy to find a good spot. The host was very kind to us, and even though he was right above us we barely ever heard anything from upstairs which was a pleasant surprise. For two women who were cautious visiting a big city like this, we felt very safe with the neighborhood (we also got to see a plethora of dogs being walked which was a delight)! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone coming down to LA, and I’d stay there again!"

Large park, grocery store, The Grove, and so much more all conveniently located nearby! We had some small maintenance issues in the beginning and the host was so attentive and prompt to help out! Keep in mind the host live above you, but I enjoyed my privacy and hope to come back very soon. This place seems to be in high demand for a good reason!! Very thankful for my month long stay here and I would have extended my trip if it wasn’t booked up for the following few months"

We used it frequently. The kitchen had everything we needed, and the shower was great!  It is in a very walkable neighborhood, and is close to bus lines, shops, restaurants and parks. We also were so happy to have a parking pass and always had a place to park on the street, either in front of the apartment or nearby."

The guesthouse was very clean and well equiped, even down to a huge array of sauces and spices in the kitchen and products in the bathroom. Very impressed that the kitchen had a big fridge, toaster over, microwave, stove, oven.. the works! The hot tub was amazing! Bedding very comfortable. All linen and towels provided. Nice big deck area. Small but comfortable lounge. Nice short walk down to the beach and a restaurant called Patricks which had good food at good prices with great service. <br/>Really appreciated the late check-out thanks Len!<br/>What we thought needed improving:<br/>Unfortunately the TV reception was poor while we stayed there, however it may have been an external problem. The stair case up to the mezzanine level is very flimsy, I do hope that Len replaces or fixes it in more securely as it seemed of dangerous construction to us. The bikes that Len has can be borrowed for free which is great, however the ones we used have just about seen their day."

It was well-appointed, had everything we needed (and more), everything was very clean and so very comfortable. Literally everything about the place was phenomenal and perfect for a travelling couple. I simply cannot say enough good things about B & C's lovely place. Street parking was a breeze and it was the perfect location - close to everywhere we wanted to go and trust us, we went to lots of places all over LA! I would stay there again in a heartbeat. Thanks for having us, Brenna and Charlie and we look forward to seeing you soon."

Brenna met us when we arrived and went through everything we needed to know about the apartment and explained parking rules, etc.  The apartment is incredible and the outdoor space is so amazing!  They even knew it was my birthday and gave me a card (drawn by their incredibly cute son Julian) and left me a cupcake in the fridge.  We absolutely loved the outdoor space, especially the fire pit.  The place has an excellent location in quick driving distance to everything you would want to see in LA.  I will be staying with Brenna and Charlie the next time I am in LA for sure!"

My husband and I were amazed at how the Bungalow was exactly as it appeared in the photos, and then some. The space is super cozy, clean and open. It's situated right behind the main house surrounded by a beautifully adorned backyard. The bed was so comfortable we fell asleep minutes after laying in it. It’s a great location for visits to Hollywood, Burbank, Venice Beach, Santa Monica and Malibu. The neighborhood is quiet with ample street parking which was great! This was our first Airbnb experience and we are very satisfied with the ease in which everything came together from the booking to our arrival. Brenna and Charlie, you are model hosts and we hope our paths cross again! -Heather & Jeffrey B."
67089,31422781,2015-05-05,5943106,Helie,"My sister and I were recently in LA visiting family and feel that we really got lucky when we got to stay at Brenna’s charming bungalow in Culver City.  Lots of space for the two of us.   The couch in the living room unfolds into a good sized bed. Very modern décor, terrific shower and well appointed kitchen...and wonderful reading material!  It was only minutes from LAX but the second you pass thru the gate into a lovely courtyard, you are out of the crazy traffic and into a calm and peaceful sanctuary.  The large, folding front doors can be opened to let in the fresh air so that you feel it's part of the patio.  Brenna and her family could not have been more gracious or accommodating.  We enjoyed an occasional chat with her and her adorable children.  Definitely a winner in the “home-away-from-home” category!"

67089,31889517,2015-05-11,859171,Dr. Judith,"Just arrived back to NYC from an amazing time in LA. My two friends and I visited for 5 days. The stay at Brenna's home in Culver City was really cool. The place was conveniently located in Culver City, with many small cafes and restaurants literally 5 minutes away. In addition, we were only no more than 25 minutes away from major attractions such as Hollywood, downtown LA and Venice Beach. Neighborhood was very quiet and residential.  I think the BEST accent to it all were the AMAZING, mouth watering chocolate cupcakes that Brenna gave us on our second day there. To die for! :) I would recommend this place for anyone looking for comfort and convenience. Thank you."
67089,32083661,2015-05-13,5510261,Romulo,"Brenna was very friendly and welcoming. The home is fabulous and just like photos.

The experience of staying in this house exceeded my expectations. It is located in the heart of LA where you can catch everything within reasonable amount of time. The hosts are very friendly and love to talk to people. The house is full of entertainment  such as cooking stuff, DVDs for new movies, directTV, books...ets. I would definitely come back to it whenever i have the chance to visit LA."
67089,32840082,2015-05-22,32278720,Jennifer,Staying in Brenna's home was truly a joy. She and her family made me feel welcome from start to finish. Any question I had was answered promptly and anything I needed was attended to right away.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The little touches that Brenna left in the home for me like fresh and healthy snacks and flowers did not go unnoticed. I also so appreciated so much that I could make a dinner like I would at home in their bungalow's fabulous kitchen,and not have to worry about buying every spice I needed,as Brenna had whatever I needed to fill in with,within her pantry.,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The location was extremely convenient as well. Her home is so close to many great restaurants and within walking distance to a grocery store which is key if you're staying for an extended period of time.,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>I should also add the bungalow is adorable,just like in the photos,as well as it is clean and again,beyond fully stocked with anything you could need during your stay.* (*Like a critical sample size shampoo that I was so grateful for when I realized I packed two bottles of conditioner and no shampoo.),,

Very clean, lots of towels, well stocked kitchen (even a blender for my smoothies!) Her place feels big because there are lots of windows to let in lots of light. We stayed an extra night and would have stayed even longer if she wasn't already booked. The one issue we had, she dealt with immediately. The only thing that could be better would be a firmer bed. But if you like a soft bed it's perfect. We will definitely stay with Brenna again if we have the chance."

She Welcomed us with a very informative binder including brochures, metro cards, recipes, etc. The kitchen was stocked with all the necessities, same for the bathroom! Everything was really thoughtful. We were even given really detailed directions on how to use every electronic in the house and how to properly lock all the doors. No steps were skipped and i would say Brenna modeled the perfect Airbnb Experience."

Our hosts were very welcoming and helpful with recommendations and any requests we had.  The size of the place was perfect for two of us. The bungalow was stocked with blankets, towels, linens, and toiletries for our use. The location was very central and close to Santa Monica, downtown LA, and Beverly Hills.

67089,70495799,2016-04-18,62894509,Vikas,It is a beautiful one bedroom apartment in a great suburb close the beach and the airport. Brenna nicely sent through the check-in instructions which was easy. The off-street parking was great too. The apartment is very well planned/decorated and the common backyard is great to enjoy when the weather is nice. We did cook for ourselves and eat in nearby restaurants (again quite a few choices here). Brenna also has made a list of restaurants you can find close by and a nice welcome with some fruits/chocolate - a nice touch. The family was very approachable and it was a real airbnb experience. We would love to stay again here!

67089,78033678,2016-06-05,2076681,Linsea,"Our experience at this property was nothing short of amazing. Brenna, Charlie and their children were welcoming, friendly and super helpful. The home comfortably fit three of us (2 in the bedroom, 1 on the couch). It was clean and exactly as pictured. The patio was wonderful for relaxing with coffee or wine and catching some California sunshine. Parking was super easy and they provide a parking pass and clear directions as to which side of the street you can park on. Culver City is a great location for experiencing all that the LA area has to offer (beaches, shopping, Hollywood, etc).  Definitely recommend breakfast at Metro Cafe and dinner at Versailles! Our stay was everything we wanted and more! You can tell that there is a lot of love on this property. We were so grateful to have found it!"

Location was ideal as it was center to all the spots we visited during our stay. They provided us with plenty of towels and linens, kept the bathroom stocked with toiletries, and the kitchen has plenty of kitchenware to get by. Parking pass is supplied, with a spot right in front of the house."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>One thing to note is that the bungalow does share it's outdoor space with the house in the front,which can get a bit awkward. It's also located in a very family-oriented neighborhood,so the 11pm curfew is strictly enforced as to not disturb the neighbors who have children- a lesson we learned on our second night. But our overall experience was amazing! Brenna was very understanding and prompt to act.,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The shower is exceptional and might have been my favorite feature!! Also,for other out-of-towners,an uber to the beach is like $5!,,,

It was exactly how the photos looked, very spacious, clean and modern.

Len had snacks and a bottle of wine for us when we arrived, and there was a binder with everything we needed to know about nearby food, parking, wifi, etc. The upper beds were a bit too squeezed for my friend but she used the pull-out couch and slept very comfortably. I'm picky about bathrooms, and this one was very clean. We brewed fresh coffee every morning that we enjoyed on the patio-- super relaxing. Not a ton of floor space but we didn't mind, nor was it advertised as such. Very nice experience overall, especially if you're looking for something quiet, pleasant and convenient."

<br/>The location is perfect to go anywhere in LA.  Sometimes we walked to Beverly Hill Centers only for 30 minutes. And parking would not be an issue,we could park around her house very easily for free. It's good for visitor who have rental car. And the neighborhood is very quite and safe.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Anyway,Sher's house has good quality for a good price.  You should choose Sher's house if you visit LA.  My husband and I look forward to coming back soon.,,,,

The place looked as pictured, cleanliness wasn't an issue at all, it was a very private luxorious stay. Don't let the \"\"guesthouse\"\" tag fool you. This was one of our favorite AirBnbs out of the many we've stayed before. Thank you guys. \""

I would definitely stay at this place again. highly recommend this place!"
67089,115088236,2016-11-21,5092329,Lesley,"Brenna's bungalow was a little haven close to many of LA's attractions. Particularly useful for Venice and Santa Monica plus the airport. The garden setting was beautiful and the property very private. It was a rare rainy night when we were there, so we didn't get to use the lovely outdoors seating. Lovely bathroom too. Thanks. This was a great place for our short LA layover."

Il est situé dans un quartier résidentiel et calme, non loin des commerces et restaurants. Culver City s'est révélé, en fait, un excellent point de chute pour visiter L.A. car cela nous a permis de nous rendre sur les principaux sites (Beverly hills, Hollywood, Griffith park, downtown, Venice, Santa Monica...) assez rapidement sans avoir à utiliser les fameuses FWY qui sont totalement saturées à certains moments de la journée. La communication avec notre hôte, Brenna, a été trés facile et nous a donnée toutes les informations utiles pour preparer au mieux notre arrivée. C'est une adresse que je vais garder pour mon prochain voyage et que je recommande vivement.<br/>"

Unfortunately we weren't there long enough to properly introduce ourselves   But she left everything one would ever need for a comfortable and cozy stay. The house helpers they have were very sweet and very immediate in their response. Definitely will recommend and I can't wait to be back. Out of all our airbnb stays across the country this has to be the most charming one!
67089,141750673,2017-04-04,26925957,Lindsay,"We had a great stay at Brenna's place in Culver City! The house is in a great location with a short drive to L.A. and Santa Monica. Very cute bungalow with ample space for the three people in our group. The shower is amazing! We had a little bit of trouble getting in when we arrived due to some guests in the main house locking the main gate, but were able to get it worked out. Other than that, we had no other issues and Brenna was a fabulous host! Definitely recommend."

Really beautiful home in a great location in LA, with the added benefit of staying in a space owned by an extremely cool, very friendly person. The room is spacious, comfortable, and made me feel right at home - it looks out on a gorgeous patio, and the breeze that came in kept the nights cool and relaxing. I would absolutely stay with Sher again, and I couldn't recommend her place any more highly."

They had everything at your finger tips down to the beach towels. This place is very close to shopping, cafes and a short drive to the beach. This was my very first airbnb and  now my expectations are very high because of this Bungalow. THANK YOU"

67089,156508580,2017-05-30,125075878,Abhishek,"Brennas place is well maintained, clean and well equipped. Since I was travelling with my parents (their first time in the US) I was a bit worried about how they would adapt, but they were absolutely happy with the accommodation. Since Ralphs is close by (< 1 mile) we were able to cook what they found convenient. Close to the airport. They have a parking, which meant I was able to rent a car and conveniently park it right outside the accommodation. We had some problems initially getting in, because of the number lock, but the housekeeper Angie (whose contact details Brenna had provided before-hand) immediately came down and showed us in."

8021,58777465,2016-01-05,42084064,Catherine,"This is the best airbnb experience I had. Sher is absolutely a great host, she made every effort to make our stay comfortable and always check up on us to make sure everything is going well. On the date of our arrival, since there's street cleaning the next morning, she even saved a parking spot for us so that we didn't have to wander around to find parking. The other days parking is readily available. The rooms are very clean and nicely decorated, with all the amenities we need. We also find the location easy to explore LA since it's in the middle of LA. We really enjoyed our stay here and loved the cute dogs. Thank you Sher for providing us with such a nice place for our stay! We will stay again."
8021,59978464,2016-01-17,6096225,Danny,"Sher is a fantastic and accommodating host supplying one of the most comfortable beds in Beverly Hills.  It's a peaceful and quiet setting to focus, and she was very patient with my odd schedule.  I am looking forward to staying there again!"
8021,63202123,2016-02-21,4167417,Megan,"My boyfriend and I stayed in Sher's suite for almost a month. We moved to LA and I started a new job. As you can imagine, we wanted a comfortable place to land in a new city. Sher's home was not only clean, cute, and convenient, but also welcoming, warm, and luxurious. The suite had everything we needed -- private bath, comfortable bed and linens, lots of natural light, and closet space. The real win was in Sher's hosting and accommodations. Sher was a pleasure to get to know over the month, cleared extra storage space for us in her garage, and threw in special touches, like refilling the drinking water in our room. I now know why Sher has such amazing reviews! Plus, I completely fell in love with Sher's dogs. If you don't like dogs, no worries, they do their own thing, but if you want to live like you have pets during your stay, get ready for some cuddles!"
8021,63645539,2016-02-25,35587516,Judith,"Sher met me at the door when I arrived and welcomed me into her home.  She gave me the tour, had some fun touristy books available, and was just lovely."

Sher provided restaurant recommendations (something you'll want for the area), and although we don't anticipate visiting LA again, we would think of Sher's if we reconsider."

The separate cottage was immaculate and stylish.  A true one bedroom with a full kitchen.  The location was well suited to LA tourist sites.  Parking was no problem and the area felt very safe when arriving back to the bungalow after dark.  Brenna and her family were very friendly and hospitable.  All in all a five star stay for us.

Thank you Brenna for your sweet hospitality your home is beautiful!

67089,208943101,2017-11-03,78463918,Carolyn,This bungalow was about as perfect as I  would like. Super cute and clean. Easy parking. Perfect location for my work. Home away from home.  I can't wait to stay there again.
67089,210315591,2017-11-08,149421656,Gail,"This clean, quiet and very modern cottage had a comfortable bed, good lighting and a well-appointed kitchen with plenty of counter space.   Brenna was very friendly, welcoming, and an excellent host.  The place is a great find and we hope to stay again on our next trip to Culver City."
67089,213550102,2017-11-21,849746,Reed,"This trip was the second time I stayed at Brenna's, and as with the first time the place, location, and Brenna's hospitality were superior.  I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a great place to stay in LA."
67089,215285048,2017-11-28,84996498,Laura,"What a terrific location, clean space and special touches like the hammock, fire pit and hot tub made this such a fun holiday get-a-way!  Great time, would recommend to our friends!!!"
67089,216938376,2017-12-06,23454406,Victoria,"We stayed here for just a night for a long layover but it was perfect for our needs. Close to LAX, super clean and very easy check-in. Since we got in so late we never met Brenna or her family but she was quick to respond to any messages, I would highly recommend this tiny little slice of paradise to anyone."
67089,217297507,2017-12-08,27856041,Derek,"If you're looking for location a bit outside of the craziness of LA, then this is your place. It's like a hotel with little touches everywhere. This is my new vacation (and business) spot while in LA!"
67089,218281196,2017-12-11,6079403,Kristin,"Perfect jumping off spot (or relaxing retreat) in West LA.  Stylish, comfortable, quiet and exceptionally clean, would recommend to any couple looking for a place to stay while in Los Angeles.  Brenna is a charming host, very welcoming and friendly.  Did I say comfortable?  We slept for 12 hours one night - haven't done that in years!<br/>The kitchen and bathroom are very modern and up to date - a delight to use. The shared backyard was so private and relaxing - really not shared as we were the only ones out there.  A perfect retreat from a hectic weekend of moving our kids from one place to another while in Culver City.<br/>We would happily stay here again."
67089,219751066,2017-12-18,40712093,卫军,It is very clean and nice place. Couple are really nice. Brenna already responses my test right way. Kitchen is fully equipped. I specially like standard hotel shower head.
67089,219938799,2017-12-19,115127540,Jon,"Everything was as good if not better than expected, very cozy."
67089,221777331,2017-12-27,46207125,Kathleen,My fiancé and I enjoyed  a wonderful three days at Brenna’s bungalow. The kitchen and bathroom where well appointed with all the utensils and gear we could need. The location is  conveniently  situated close to the freeway and  all LA has to offer. Brenna was an excellent host and went the extra mile to receive packages for me so I did not have to carry Christmas gifts across the country. All in all it was a great stay in Culver City – highly recommend.
67089,222389343,2017-12-29,132634533,Alisha,This space was beautiful and the perfect spot for our two-night stayover in the LA area before continuing on our travels. It’s as little as 10 minutes from the airport if you catch traffic at the right time. We brought an inflatable toddler mattress and this was perfect for a family of 4 with two littles. The yard and outdoor space make it very special and Brenna’s hospitality and organization make it a truly wonderful place to call Home for however long you stay. Definitely recommend!
67089,223134829,2017-12-31,29494726,Stephan,Wir haben zu dritt in Brenna´s Apartment übernachtet und es hat alles gepasst. Der Check-In war klasse sowie die freunliche Kommunikation von Brenna - die Lage ist ebenso Ideal für alle Touren rund um LA. <br/>Würde jederzeit wieder hier buchen!
67089,224266629,2018-01-02,80163664,Mikelle,The Bungalow is charming and clean.  The entire space feels peaceful.  There are so many thoughtful touches and the shower is amazing!
67089,227059495,2018-01-13,60649845,Steve,"Perfect little hideaway in Culver City! Brenna was super-responsive, and the bungalow is stylishly appointed and very clean. It’s not in an especially walkable neighborhood, but, hey, this is L.A. (Cue the song by Missing Persons here.) Great food and coffee is just a few minutes away by car.<br/>Very happy with our choice. Would stay here again!"
67089,229029369,2018-01-21,8006427,Harper,"Great space for our 2 kid family.  Clean and well appointed with those thing you need to travel with small children.  Bungalow separate from a larger house with a shared back yard.  We didn’t have the time to enjoy the yard— fire pit, play yard, hot tub and hammock, but are already looking forward to getting some friends together to go back and rent the entire complex!!"
67089,229827539,2018-01-25,667874,Amanda,"Brenna's lovely bungalow getaway is perfect in every way. She could not have been nicer, and it's very clear how much she and her family have invested in making this a special place to stay."
67089,230966157,2018-01-29,6521619,Brian,"Brenna's accommodations are superb.  Super clean, modern, with everything you need.  She is a wonderful host who is quick to respond with any questions.  The location in Culver City is terrific (easy walk to the grocery store, bus stops, and more), and the neighborhood is so quiet.  This is the only place where we want to stay when my friends and I visit LA!"
217971,353372613,2018-11-27,35516652,Robin,"Len's place was just as advertised.  Very comfortable, easy to get around. Will be back"
217971,403383434,2019-01-20,111209550,Erin,"Our stay at Len's place was fantastic.  The location was great; just a short walk to the beach and a quick car ride to Santa Monica pier and downtown.  We were happy to find parking available for two cars (driveway for one and street parking for the other). <br/>There is one proper queen bed downstairs, with one queen and one twin mattress in the loft.  There is also a small futon downstairs that can be collapsed for sleeping.  It's close quarters for a group of five adults, but it's quite comfortable if you're willing to get cozy.  Our group had no problem with the stairs to the loft, but they are narrow and might be difficult for some.<br/>Our favorite feature of this airbnb were the amenities.  The patio area is cute and spacious, with a space heater to keep you warm at night.  Our group loved using the hot tub on the property, but do take note that it is shared with the other guests and main house.  The laundry facilities are also shared, and were in use during our stay.  The one bathroom has a large luxurious shower that is well stocked with shampoo and conditioner.  The snacks and wine that Len provided were a happy surprise!"
217971,404916965,2019-01-25,228756866,Evan,"Great location, within walking distance of the beach. Host was very friendly and accommodating."
217971,426024799,2019-03-19,233652924,Jorma,"A neat little cottage with patio in the back of the yard . Takes two adults and 1-3 kids or a bunch of flexible young people. Well equipped kitchen, bikes and beach towels available. Parking is possible in the driveway,  short walking distance to the beach. Len is a friendly and helpful host. A courtesy bottle of Californian wine was a lovely surprise!"
217971,475696154,2019-06-24,190295599,Christelle,"Super emplacement proche de la plage, facile d accès. Très chouette terrasse bien aménagée."

217971,515349577,2019-08-22,222689809,Clare,"Lovely place, use of bikes, beach toys etc.  Was perfect after a day at the beach/ sightseeing- super close to beach and restaurants"
217971,534503338,2019-09-22,22603185,Stephen,"This place is perfect for walking to the beach, biking up the coast, or heading out for fantastic dinner.   Comfortable, clean, and well appointed."
217971,559346605,2019-11-03,4080102,Sarah,Wonderful place with a beautiful patio and excellent location--just a few blocks to the beach or restaurants. We really appreciated the thoughtful touches and great communication--couldn't have asked for a better space for our trip!
217971,617338223,2020-03-12,22168655,Virge,We absolutely loved our stay at Len’s guest house.  Everything was so thoughtfully ready for us from snack and coffee to  beach towels and local tips.  Our two kids (age 11 and 17) loved the sleeping loft.  Will definitely stay again given the chance!
217971,634099776,2020-07-02,4855755,Hillary,"This place was absolutely perfect. It was comfy, spotless, tastefully laid out, and decorated. The gorgeous greener of the Santa Monica Canyon makes you feel like you are in your own jungle garden and not in a busy city. The outdoor deck was perfectly set up to enjoy at all times of the day with a heat lamp and grill.  Len has bikes, coolers, and all kinds of beach stuff available. If you are looking for a spot in the Santa Monica area, close to an amazing (not super crowded) beach,  a bike path ride or walk away to the Santa Monica pier, that is also pleasurable to hang out in, then look no further. This place is a gem. We will definitely be back."
217971,640633919,2020-07-20,246421154,Sagar,"Sweet space, pleasant patio, great location, nice host - what’s not to love?"
217971,662203464,2020-09-08,261839051,Marta,"Our stay was absolutely perfect. Len and Jan's place is in the perfect location: walkable to the beach and close to many good restaurants. The beach house kitchen and bathroom are so well equipped with everything you might need: from shower caps and hair conditioner to assortment of coffee and chocolates! The host is super nice and happy to help out with anything. The place is very cosy, especially the attic is such a great spot to hide for a nap or read a book. Highly recommended!"
217971,669432944,2020-09-29,5579233,Karen,Len’s home is beautiful and the outdoor area to sit in is very peaceful!
217971,707224872,2020-11-07,222406845,Zoe,"Beautiful and cozy place just several blocks from the Santa Monica beach! Everything about this airbnb was amazing- the private outdoor patio, the hot tub, the comfortable bed, and the available bikes were our favorite! Len is an awesome host!! We will definitely be staying here again on our next trip to LA."
217971,709264955,2020-11-15,65262860,Martin,"Len's place is very clean, nice and in a great location. The hospitality was outstanding and I had a wonderful time. Will definitely be back.<br/>The patio area was especially cool!"
217971,712393139,2020-11-29,47493271,Linda,Len was an ideal host; super accommodating and generous. The cottage was great. Ideally located for walking to the beach and exploring Santa Monica.
217971,713337980,2020-12-04,37577676,Darragh,"Len was really helpful and prompt in all responses. Great location, the hot tub was a nice touch and outside heaters were amazing. We really enjoyed our time here."
8021,76313573,2016-05-26,4582478,Lyn,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay in Sher's apt. Everything was as described. The room was beautifully decorated and the room and bath  were very clean. Sher made us french press coffee, which really helped get our day started and was a wonderful treat. The area was very nice. We were able to walk to some restaurants which Sher recommended, and where the food was very good. We liked the fact that we could do some laundry and that if we come back in the summer, there is air conditioning, which is a must in L.A. All in all, Sher was a wonderful, gracious, friendly host, and I would certainly stay here again."
8021,80544249,2016-06-18,53468271,Paul &Amp; Mireille,Our first two nights of our road trip started with two nights at Sher's place. Sher made us feel very welcome as she  made us fresh water for our room and fresh coffee and tea to get the day started at breakfast.
<br/>She provided us with the best tip ever... Having dinner at Pistola's. We never had such tasteful pasta in our lives. We have been to Italy several times,but this was really the best.,,,,
<br/>The room was very tidy and clean and we were even allowed to use part of the kitchen (fridge to cool some of our food). We also had our own bathroom next to the bedroom.,,,,,
<br/>It was furthermore very convenient that we could easily park our car close to Sher's home for free!,,,,,
<br/>,,,,,

8021,81885647,2016-06-25,49527137,Jason,Sher是个很好的房东 入住前电话我们没有接到 还联系到Airbnb工作人员联系我们 很是感动 到了很热情的接待了我们 还推荐了好吃的Sushi 房间相当不错很干净 还有两条可爱的狗狗
8021,84032625,2016-07-05,13564940,Shari & Pieter,"Location. Location. Location! You will not find a better one in Beverly Hills, so convenient. My husband and I walk a lot, and even though they say nobody walks in L.A., we did. We found amazing food, museums and shopping galore. We didn't spend a lot of time in the room, but it was quite comfortable and the shower pressure was Heaven. We hope to visit again if Sher will have us."
8021,86220512,2016-07-15,80630530,Ben,"Sher was an awesome host. She contacted me before I arrived and confirmed my arrival time, then even saved a street parking space for me next to her place and greeted me on the street when I arrived. She was always immediately available by text if I had questions and a great resource for learning about the L.A. area and even had a small library of materials about the history and sights throughout the city. We had many enjoyable discussions out in the peaceful back garden with the dogs. The room is extremely clean (as in the picture) and peaceful and the private adjoining bathroom was a nice bonus, as was the freshly brewed morning coffee. I would be a fool not to return here, but unfortunately I am moving to L.A., so I will instead highly recommend it for a great place to stay to gently introduce you to the real L.A. lifestyle."
8021,87933572,2016-07-22,18383358,Laura,"Sher was great. At my arrival she welcomed me with a glass of wine, offered me breakfast in the morning. She is a fantastic host to talk with.<br/>The room and bathroom are clean and colorful. Very practical. No need to bring soaps there's everything you can find in a starred hotel.<br/>Once more thanks Sher for letting me feel like home."

67089,233027092,2018-02-07,69813918,Austen,"Brenna's place was absolutely great! It was very clean and comfortable. Her and her family were very kind when we ran in to each other and always asking if there was anything else we needed. <br/>She provides a very detailed booklet that includes helpful information for the TV, internet, trash, etc., as well as a list of local menus and food recommendations. Parking was always available right out front and the location is great if you're looking to visit both sides of the city. We'd definitely stay here again!"

8021,97023548,2016-08-25,88458329,Rick,"Sher, provided me with a wonderful first-time Airbnb experience.  The room has a private bath and is as beautiful as the pictures. The bed and pillows were very comfortable--and I am very picky when it comes to beds and pillows. A fresh pitcher of water was set out in the room. Coffee and conversation were offered, and the conversation was engaging. What more could one want? I highly, highly recommend Sher!"
8021,99238190,2016-09-04,545543,Karen,Sher was there on our arrival to make sure that we settled in ok and she provided fantastic information about places to go and how to get there.

8021,100139831,2016-09-07,3261539,Renate,"This was my fourth stay at Sherree’s place and from my first stay in 2012 it has felt like a home away from home. It’s my go-to place whenever I’m in L.A. It’s in a quiet area in a very central location.<br/>Sherree is the ideal host. She is very welcoming, friendly and helpful and a great person to talk to. She makes great breakfasts and very tasty morning coffee. She has a great knowledge of the area, of things to do, restaurants and current activities, shows and happenings in the L.A. area. Her place is just as described and the room and bed are very comfortable and convenient. Her dogs are really sweet.<br/>I highly recommend her place. You really couldn’t ask for more! Thank you again, Sherree!"

67089,238484434,2018-02-25,13937246,Darin,This is my second time staying at one of Brenna's spaces.  This is the first time in the bungalow. Everything is nicely done with a modern feel. The space is convenient to shopping and entertainment and to the 405. <br/>Brenna was very quick with replies and communication. <br/>I would recommend either of Brenna's spaces to any travellers.
67089,239216629,2018-02-28,171887237,Lisa,Brenna’s place was absolutely delightful. Very trendy and spacious. We were impressed by the comfortable bed! Everything was as it looks and described. Would definitely stay again when we come back to LA!

67089,246095489,2018-03-24,53293591,Antony,"This home is exclusive - book it right away!  Now the details: The stay is in a guesthouse near the main home and that gives you warmth as well as good privacy. Plenty of entertainment for the kids in their backyard garden area, as well as a nice pad for adults to just chill. The guesthouse has a queen bedroom with sliding doors and living room with a couch which also converts to a full size bed. Great visiting tips in their guest handbook. Interior finishings are new and contemporary style. Location is great located central to Santa Monica, Downtown, original Farmers market area and Venice beach. Host is very friendly, with great communication and they are seasoned travelers themselves."
67089,247759399,2018-03-29,30538198,Jude,"Brenna's guest house is everything the add promised and more.  It was the perfect size for my partner and I and was some how the perfect peaceful oasis in the middle of a major metropolitan area.  It was close to the airport and the beach and just a beautiful retreat to return to every day.  If I ever need lodging in LA again, I will be sure to see if the Bungalow id available!"
67089,249165531,2018-04-01,62552851,Deneen,"This little bungalow is perfect! We wish we could have stayed longer than the weekend!

Thanks Brenna!"
67089,250612741,2018-04-05,11699392,Eyal,Great place to stay in Culver City. We had a car and everything was in driving distance from us. The jacuzzi was great fun and we made a really tasty steak dinner with the outdoorBBQ grill.

217971,717925397,2020-12-24,72866208,Arun,Len was a great host. He was always trying to be helpful the whole trip. He had a bunch of great suggestions for things to do in the area and his guesthouse is in a perfect location if you want to be close to the beach and all the action.

8021,113139651,2016-11-10,25242044,Stephen,"A fantastic place to stay, probably my favourite in all AirBnB experiences within LA so far. Amazing host (420 friendly) in a clean and tidy apartment near to Wilshire, Robertson and La Cienega Blvds. The room is exactly as advertised and quiet and cool in the day time for a home-office when needed. I had so much fun hanging out with the host and her neighbours, a mutual love for a good GnT :). The pets were also great... Lots of fun laughing at their antics!! I'll miss them all and so sad to leave !!!! Hopefully I'll stay back there next year. Xx"
8021,124801046,2017-01-02,15652393,Xueying,It's in the residential neighborhood so very quiet.

8021,128956842,2017-01-28,12691511,Rebecca,Sher is a great host. Fun and warm. Easy to communicate with. Her dogs are sweet and well behaved. Thanks Sher for making me feel like staying at home
8021,130117844,2017-02-04,87398427,Qianqian,very good location and very nice Sher，it's very convenient that we may use kitchen and laundry. Sher is a very easy going person and we feel very happy to stay in her house.
8021,133172658,2017-02-20,47229994,Joshua,"The character and the ambience of the place made my stay feel home away from home. I was here on business and the simple fact the bed was comfy was all I needed to get my z's to have a productive visit. Set up and layout of living space is just right - as is everything else. One thing to note who will have rentals. Do not park parallel street due north overnight... I got a 60ish dollar ticket from the friends at the Beverly Hills police department. You need a permit. All in all, an exceptional experience."
8021,134878003,2017-03-01,4676679,Daniela,"Sher is a great host and very nice. The apartment is very well situated in Beverly and it is very nice to have breakfast in the sunshine in the morning either inside or outside. Sher is very helpful for any suggestion, question you might need."
8021,140745116,2017-03-31,27341283,Luigi,"Sher is a wonderful Hostess, funny smart and always up for watching some late night Netflix Comedy specials.   And her two dogs are the best company when you all alone watching TV or just hanging in the sunny breakfast room having that first cup of Joe.   The other plus is the outside patio, great place to just chill out with a glass of wine.   Would stay again for sure."
8021,145528085,2017-04-18,25242044,Stephen,"This was the second time I stayed at Sher's place.. as I had such a great time when we stayed with her last year. The residence is clean and tidy, centrally located in LA and walkable (~10mins) to 3rd St where there are shops and bars. The area is quiet and very safe. Sher is a friendly and fun host to stay with and I'm truly sad to have checked-out today!"
8021,146344756,2017-04-22,88407405,Gaynor,"Make sure you get the full address, what I mean by that get her number of her place, because it caused my husband and I myself extreme stress, after travelling from Australia we didn't need it.  The location was good, but steps are a big issue."
8021,158451704,2017-06-06,93793374,Jessie,A very good place to stay in LA. Sher was a great host. She texted us before arrival and talked with us friendly. The room was comfortable and clean. The location was perfect for Beverly Hills lovers.
8021,163174150,2017-06-23,131939783,Virginia,We had a wonderful stay!
8021,172099857,2017-07-19,74316715,Latha,"We stayed in Sher's place for 2 nights. Sher made us feel welcome and was able to give us clear guidance on getting around, where to eat and places to see. The room itself is very quiet and comfortable. We had a great sleep for the 2 nights. Sher also provided us with coffee and cakes which was very kind. We also bonded well with her dogs Hazel and Buddy. We would definitely stay with Sher if we were to visit LA again"

8021,190745683,2017-09-04,41827151,Priyadarshini,"Sher was an absolutely wonderful host! She is extremely warm, gracious and very accommodating. I will miss her lovely dogs and the freshly brewed coffee every morning. I really enjoyed my stay at her gorgeous apartment. The location was also great - short Uber rides to most places in Beverly Hills."

8021,212415516,2017-11-17,11710064,Sarah,"Sher is the most wonderful, generous hostess -- she runs such a warm and welcoming home, complete with two very sweet puppies. She made coffee each morning, and drove me to the grocery store and all the way out to Pasadena.  I cannot recommend her pretty and spacious home enough -- including its location for travellers without cars: a 15-20-min. walk to Trader Joe's (by the Beverley Center) & LACMA; a 5-min walk to the Margaret Herrick Library/Academy of Motion Pictures Library. I would definitely stay here again."
8021,220119805,2017-12-20,63943518,Lillian,地理位置不错，离我公司很近，上班打车不到10分钟就到了。附近比较安全。但是她家的佣人有点笨，一次把我的衣物跟房东的袜子混在一起洗了，我国内带的塑料杯子给我扔了，我喝果汁的杯子藏在袋子里面她居然也翻出来给我丢了。别的还好了
8021,222816385,2017-12-30,39745320,John,"Excellent location for that part of LA. Available street parking nearby. Private bath and outside access are a big plus, too. Kitchen and living/dining areas are open to cook and sit."

8021,236274472,2018-02-18,142254353,Rossella,"Sher is an amazing person, kind, sociable and funny! She has great taste for interior design and her house is so cute and comfortable that you will never forget your LA experience if you stay by her! Additionally, the area where the house is located is super safe, pleasant, and quiet, but also at walking distance from supermarkets, bars, cafès and restaurants! And very conveniently located to go anywhere in the city. Super super super recommended! I will surely stay by her again next year! Rossella, Italy"
8021,249763167,2018-04-02,77571845,Marjorie,Sher was a wonderful and very accommodating host—plus I fell in love with her doggies! The room and bed were very comfortable and the neighborhood lovely.
8021,260393123,2018-05-04,116395070,Kim,"Sher is an absolutely AMAZING host.  I cannot say enough about my stay.  She made me feel right at home.  It was if I had known her my entire life.  Sher was extremely attentive and made sure I had everything I needed.  Her house is extremely clean and you have everything you would need at your disposal in her kitchen.  The location is amazing - close to the Grove, Beverly Center....all of the LA site!  OH!!  And I cannot forget Buddy and Hazel!!  They are an absolute delight!!  I would recommend Sher’s home if you are looking for a great Airbnb experience."
8021,301731554,2018-08-04,183827090,Soo,Me and my 10 year old daughter stayed at Sher's house for 2 weeks. It was my first bnb experience and was a bit nervous and scared at first to be honest. But as I met Sher she made me feel right at home and I know we were in good hands.^^ We had such a great time! My daughter is usually scared of dogs but just loved buddy and hazel. I don't think she'll be afraid of dogs any more. Sher gave me so much  useful information we were able to do a lot more than what we had planned.  Going to the Hollywood bowl to see Annie was the most unexpected and memorable event for me and my daughter. Sher made sure we were able to street park each night and having our own bathroom and being able to use the washer and dryer whenever we needed was great too.  When Sher was away for a few days JC from down stairs was always willing to help us with anything we may need. She was like a mom~ Sher's place was just perfect for the two of us!
8021,310621226,2018-08-19,53440568,Areef,Sher fully exceeded our expectations. We stayed in LA for 3 nights and she helped us organize our days and really went above and beyond with the touches in her space. She is warm and welcoming. We felt at home. I would highly recommend her amazing space to anyone travelling in the area.
8021,315039700,2018-08-27,17598574,Simon,Sher is a great host and knows so much about the area and LA in general. After over 24 hours of travel she was so welcoming and helpful and hung out with us before we hit the hay. Highly recommended and great if you want to live that Beverly Hills lifestyle.
8021,323051543,2018-09-14,204917425,Mariam,"Sher is literally such a kind, genuine, & hospitable host! I was traveling alone & stayed at her beautiful home for two weeks. Sher made me feel so welcome & she would always have coffee ready in the morning. Her home is located in a very nice and safe neighborhood. All the recommendations Sher provided for restaurants, coffee shops, & places I need to go see were amazing. She really went above & beyond as a host. I'm extremely grateful to have someone who not only ensured my stay was comfortable but that I was also having a fun vacation. Her home was very clean & I really loved the decor in the house! Her dogs Buddy & Hazel are so adorable & I enjoyed having them around! Thank you Sher for really being so caring, kind and an amazing host! I loved staying at your place and it was so nice meeting you! I'll definitely be back soon!"
8021,328257580,2018-09-25,806718,Tasha,"My husband and I stayed at Sher's place for three nights. We really enjoyed our time and everything the place had to offer! The check in was super easy, the gps has no troubles locating and getting you to the address provided. Sher had no problems with our last minute reservation and later evening check in. She immediately made us feel like you are visiting an old friend! <br/>The room as well as the apartment have a great vibe! The room has a large window, and a good amount of space/closet to tuck your things away. The private bathroom is clean and is a great plus.  The shower has great water pressure and water temperature, with shampoo/body wash. <br/>Sher was kind to make great coffee in the morning. She was also very helpful when we locked ourselves out later in the night and she had to let us in. Dont forget to take your key for the night, i was silly to forget mine:(<br/>It takes about $5 on Uber to get you to West Hollywood, there is TJ and liquor shop walking distance.  <br/>We had a great stay, exceeding our expectations. We will be staying here any time we are in LA.  Definitely recommend it if you are spending time in the area!"

8021,439764221,2019-04-19,249339723,Mohita,Sher's the best person you could stay at in LA. She really makes you feel at home and ensures your stay in comfortable. She is a fun person to hangout with and I loved my conversations with her. Made me great tea every morning too :)

8021,452271724,2019-05-12,260261554,Ted,"\"Sher was the perfect host!! Not a single comfort or convenience  was overlooked.  The beautiful home and patio area were sparkling clean and Sher was a wealth of knowledge on the area with books and pamphlets on the many sights to see!! This B and B is definitely a keeper! Conrad Hilton, when alive, couldn’t have made a guest feel more at home and valued!! 5 stars is an understatement! I’m still patting myself on the back for finding this Gem! BRAVO!! - Christine <br/>Enjoyed the 1930s architecture & atmosphere of the home, as well as walkable pleasant neighborhood, within blocks of major streets to venture off sightseeing in the LA/Beverly Hills area. Sher made our short visit enjoyable and relaxing. We felt quite \"\"at home\"\" and at ease with use of all rooms: kitchen"

8021,489452153,2019-07-16,129560513,Sophie,I had an amazing time staying at Sher’s apartment. The space was stunning and in the perfect location. Sher gave amazing advice about places to visit that I wouldn’t have thought to go otherwise. Her dogs are a delight and Sher is really fun to hang out with. Lots of great memories to take away.

8021,523019693,2019-09-02,185419995,Ryshon,I had an amazing weekend at Sher's...Beautiful home in an ideal location that was central to everything. Sher hospitality was top notch and greatly appreciated! Thank you Sher!!
8021,531948859,2019-09-18,19924331,Giulia,"Sher has been an outstanding, amazing, excellent host! I booked her place for my parents and they had absolutely a blast. The place was super clean, sparkling clean. The decor was very nice and Sher always has flowers! She also spoiled them with the best breakfasts, they were happily surprised! The location is great, just so easy to get everywhere. Sher is very responsive and the communication very easy! They would definitely come back! Thank you Sher!"
8021,537493819,2019-09-28,216425416,Sharon,"I wish I lived here, I never wanted to leave!  Sher was warm and made me feel as if I was the MOST important guest she ever had. Her place is absolutely charming,  with lots of live plants, exquisite furnishings and very relaxing atmosphere. The bed is very comfortable and she has included every item a traveler made need.  All of her cleaning products and toiletries are very nice, lush towels, fluffy duvet, chilled ice carafe on the nightstand , nothing overlooked . She also has a number of very nice books and magazines about the area making it easy to find out about the different neighborhoods and areas of interest. But I never wanted to leave her charming courtyard and conversation. Sher is never intrusive , but open to a new friendship if her guest is. I will be back to LA to visit in the future and there is no other place for me, I look forward to my next visit. Sher, thank you so much!"
8021,568796629,2019-11-24,2432119,Victoria,"Perhaps many years of hosting have led to Sher becoming careless with her approach, or perhaps she was having a rough month personally, but the glowing reviews I read about this listing were not reflective of my experience here. I have never given an unfavorable review to a host before, but I feel it is only responsible for me to share my honest evaluation.<br/>I had booked a month-long stay with Sher, looking forward to a sparkling clean home with a personable host on the property – I’m a frequent traveler to LA and have had some of the best experiences staying with several lovely ladies in their beautiful homes!<br/>My experience here went downhill after the initial correspondences, during which Sher was quick to respond over text and offered to give me a ride from the cafe I was waiting in as my flight had arrived before her stipulated check-in time. My living quarters were not very clean: I found hairs from the previous guest (both head and nether regions) in the bathroom as well as grime build-up on the toilet seat and behind the knick-knacks on the sink. The build-up of dust and dog hair around the shared spaces triggered my allergies. Sher later apologized about the mess as her usual housekeeper was on long-term leave, and so she was handling the cleaning by herself – I inquired about any plans for a replacement housekeeper but Sher insisted that she did a better job than her housekeeper would’ve. I understand that these things can happen, and so I cleaned the bathroom myself with equipment I purchased on my own.<br/>Standards of cleanliness vary from person-to-person and so this in itself wouldn’t have warranted a negative review, but what truly unsettled me was the degree to which I felt my every movement in her house was scrutinized, judged, and met with suspicion. From derisive comments about why I had bought and used “so much tissue” because it was “very non-ecological” (I had bought paper towels to wipe down the surfaces in the bathroom on Day 1), passive-aggressive remarks about things like how I placed her throw pillows in the closet, to a full-on yelling interrogation later in the week because she was upset that I locked my bedroom door when I left the house – she had abruptly texted me “We need to speak when you get back.” while I was at lunch with some friends, and I cut it short to come back because it sounded grave. I had to calmly explain to her that as a single woman traveling alone, locking your room door is only natural for a sense of security especially since she prefers to leave both her front and back doors unlocked throughout the day; she still had the master key to the guest bedroom, and so I was not obstructing her entry in case of an emergency. For some reason, she was taken by the idea that I was doing so as an act of deliberate offense to her to say that I did not trust her or like her, and raised her voice at me like I was an errant teenager in need of a scolding. After I made it clear that this was not an appropriate way to speak to a guest, she backed down and corrected her tone, but this would turn out to be just the first of such incidents.<br/>I appreciate that some hosts may offer a hotel-like service of refreshing your room everyday, which I would’ve been very accepting of and grateful for, but this felt like pure invasion of privacy with accompanying commentary about what’s in your trash and where you’ve placed things. She would be insistent on letting herself into the guest bedroom whenever suited her fancy, and when I later told her that I would prefer she didn’t let herself into my room while I was away, her response was that it’s her house and she can do as she pleases – “I’ve been doing this for 10 years, and your unique, personal discomfort is not my responsibility”. Verbatim.<br/>Our communication was always laden with such condescension, in a holier-than-thou “This is how we do things over here” way that can only lead you to wonder if there might be an underlying racial element involved. Staying with Sher for a month was like living in a real-life Jekyll and Hyde: we would sometimes exchange pleasantries in person if she was in a good mood, and the next thing I knew I would be on the receiving end of a slew of antagonistic texts while I’m out and I would then have to talk her through her latest wave of hysteria. I never knew what was going to set her off, and she never seemed to understand that there are certain boundaries you do not cross when it comes to interacting with Airbnb guests.<br/>Other notes: Sher has a male roommate with a 3rd dog (neither are on the listing) living in close proximity to the guest bedroom (the doors face each other). He was very pleasant compared to her.<br/>Overall I found Sher to be a bully who seemed to take delight in engaging her guests in relentless arguments, and loved to brandish the phrase “none of my guests in 10 years have ever done/mentioned this before” whenever she doesn’t get her way; for me, none of my previous hosts since I’ve started using Airbnb in 2012 have ever been this unpleasant or temperamental. I would have left after Day 2 if I had been able to find alternative accommodations, but I put a significant amount of money down on this long-stay reservation and I don’t think this would have qualified me for a refund under Airbnb’s cancellation policy. <br/>Despite what the good reviews say, I would not in good faith recommend anyone stay here, especially long-term."
67089,260716893,2018-05-04,146947530,Toni,Brenna’s place is stylist and private. Walkable to grocery store and several places to eat. Easy access to the 405 and the 10.  Brenna and her family are very hospitable and knowledgeable of the area. Would recommend staying at Brenna’s.
67089,263744496,2018-05-12,76657209,Mike,"Our return stay at Brenna's modern craftsman was another fantastic experience.  Brenna is very friendly and welcoming and quick to respond to questions.  The accommodations are clean, fully equipped and lack nothing.  Importantly, the neighborhood is safe and there is always easy parking.  Location in Culver City is great.  All in all another wonderful stay with Brenna."
67089,265344343,2018-05-16,19308049,Ellen,"Brenna and Charlie's bungalow is very clean, comfortable, quiet and perfectly located for getting around Los Angeles. The updated kitchen and bathroom are beautifully designed and the separate step down bedroom is roomy.  Check-in and check-out are very easy and parking is convenient. Brenna and Charlie are wonderful hosts and were readily available to answer any questions we had. We can't wait to stay with them again when we return to Los Angeles."
67089,266943144,2018-05-20,167367154,Ashley,Great place to stay. Guest house provided everything we needed! It was also within 20 minutes of driving from every place we wanted to go!

67089,270265940,2018-05-28,155246570,Andrea,"I really enjoyed Brenna's place! This was my first AIRBNB experience and I was extremely satisfied. Brenna communicated with me prior to our stay and was very quick to respond to my questions and concerns. Because I had two small children with me, I asked to check in a bit early and she was very accommodating. She was out of town for the weekend so we didnt get a chance to meet but her check in details via email were very detailed. We crossed paths with the housekeeper, Angie. She was very sweet and gave us a quick tour of where everything was. The home was stylish and clean. The location was perfect and central to everything. We could access the beaches, hollywood, and the LA zoo in very short uber rides that cost $20 or less for the trip. We loved the hammock and outside space where my son could run around and get that energy out. Our stay was very short so we didnt use much. We didnt take advantage of the fully set up kitchen or the grill and jacuzzi. There were snacks like nuts, trail mix and cookies on the table along with a book of all the local businesses and restaurants which was very nice. My son and I slept in the bed which was super comfortable and my best friend and her baby slept on the futon which she said felt very comfortable. Overall, the look of the home was very stylish, the comfort was great and Brenna set us up for success, so much so that I didnt need to reach out to her the entire trip. We'll definitely be back."

The layout was fabulous and the shower is one of the best I’ve found of any airbnb I’ve stayed in. The garden area is a welcome retreat from the busy city! Can’t recommend the place enough :)

Brenna was amazing from the time I placed my reservation to the time I checked out & left detailed instructions precheck-in. There’s also a bunch of menus in a binder if you wanted to order take out and have a night in.<br/>"

We spent one month with Sher and her lovely dogs who all warmly welcome us in LA. Sher, as  already mentioned by multiple reviews, is very kind and helpful, always willing to share her love of the city. We spent a very pleasant time in their company!<br/>Francais: Sher a une maison toute mignone situee dans une partie sur, jolie et pratique de Los Angeles. Le Grove (une aire commerciale), des supermarches et des boutiques sont a proximite de marche. Nous avons passe 1 mois avec Sher et ces 3 adorables petits chiens qui nous ont acceuilli chaudement a LA. Nous confirmons les multiples revues positives deja postees sur le site, Sher est tres gentille, toujours prete a aider et a partage ses conseilles pour profiter de la ville qu'elle aime. Nous avons passe un tres bon moment en leur companie!"

It did not feel at all that I was in an Air BnB, it more felt sad if I was staying with my aunt! <br/>She looked after me and made sure I knew the best places to walk around and eat. <br/>I was doing my internship and at times I needed to work or study and the place was quiet and I had my own private area to relax and prepare for the next day. <br/>I am going to miss this place and I will definitely stay there again anytime I need to be in LA!"
9140,3642309,2013-02-26,3151773,Paul,"Wendell is a treat of a host. The place is really at the center of everything in town and easy to get to things in greater LA too. separate entrance so it feels private. Had a good time, thanks!"
67089,282923143,2018-06-28,4667766,Andrew,"“Second time visit”!!!<br/>The bungalow did not disappoint!<br/>Will definitely stay again!<br/>Initially stayed at this lovely bungalow 5yrs ago with my family and have returned once again! It has not disappointed, its a very tranquil spot in Culver City, beautiful and peaceful as you first walk throughout the front gates of the property and it’s a perfect location as a central base to explore LA works extremely well, very accessible to Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, Venice, Disneyland etc.<br/>The place is well set-up and we loved just hanging out at night on the outside lounge relaxing after our hard days exploring the tourist hotspots of LA.<br/>It’s a nice, clean, safe area and felt very comfortable with my family staying in this amazing bungalow.<br/>It ticks all the box’s, it’s clean, it’s safe, it’s got plenty of space, great outdoor area, free parking and all the essentials you need to live (Fridge, Kitchen, Tv etc)...<br/>What makes this Airbnb great is the host, Brenna and her family is amazing and made us felt very welcomed and communication was excellent!<br/>Would definitely recommend this place to others and we would happily return next time we’re in LA!"
67089,284648915,2018-07-01,174217775,Kristin,Walked everywhere and rode a bike to Venice Beach on the trail.  LA Fitness near by with a lot of choices in classes and things to do.
67089,285802507,2018-07-04,4842097,Doug And Sheila,"This was the perfect quiet oasis in LA for us. The place was well appointed and very artfully decorated, and worked well with the parents in the comfy queen bed behind pocket doors and our tall teen son on the couch-turned-futon bed in the LR. The place had ample hang out spaces from the outdoor couches and fire pit, or the backyard hammock and jacuzzi. We loved the quiet garden aspect of this place, as well as staying in Culver City which has plenty of dining options. We even toured about on Bird electric scooters some, which was a blast. Would definitely recommend staying here, and would stay here again in a heartbeat."
67089,291959413,2018-07-16,31168,Kristina + Ben,"Great place to stay! Easy on street parking, quiet, private, and the unit is well laid out and spacious. We didn't use the kitchen, but it was well equipped with tools. Clean, great location, we'd absolutely stay there again. Restaurant tip: Lonzo's Bakery and Peruvian cafe on Washington, casual but delicious. Get the lomo saltado w/rib eye."
67089,295606969,2018-07-23,60633411,Amber,"We LOVED our stay here! The space was stylish and very comfortable, and the outdoor space was like a little oasis in the midst of the city. Communication with Brenna was easy and the location was easy to get to anywhere relatively quickly. We would definitely recommend and stay here again!"
67089,296882323,2018-07-26,171620898,Christophe,"Nous recommandons vivement cet hébergement si vous souhaitez découvrir LA comme nous l’avons fait.<br/>Culver City est proche de tout, en voiture comme en transport en commun, (Venice, downtown, voire Malibu) et cet hébergement est situé dans un quartier agréable, tranquille, sûr. Il est par ailleurs très bien équipé (jacuzzi ;-) ). Enfin, il est à proximité de nombreux restos sympas et de supermarchés."
67089,298765635,2018-07-29,34299689,Emily,"This is a great little bungalow in Culver City. Everything was as peaceful, comfortable, and beautiful as the pictures indicate. I loved opening up the accordion doors for a truly indoor/outdoor experience. Would happily stay here again!"
67089,299856842,2018-07-31,1573455,Erin,"I had a wonderful stay at Brenna's place. It's a beautiful little cottage tucked away in her backyard--comfortable, cozy, clean, stylish, and she has truly thought of just about everything a guest might need during his or her stay. I enjoyed sitting out on the gorgeous patio (and that amazing SoCal weather!), and doing my morning yoga practice with the sliding doors open to the cool morning air. I only wish I could have stayed a bit longer."
67089,305068016,2018-08-10,111730495,Sandrine,Logement conforme à la description . Propre avec toutes les aménités nécessaires . Produits de premiers consommation disponibles . Très grande réactivité de l'hôte . C'est un logement avec jardin partagé avec la maison des propriétaires . Nous y avons logé pour la deuxième fois pendant 10 jours . Les propriétaires étaient absents durant notre séjour . Leur maison principale est louée pendant leurs absences et vous devez partager le jardin et les équipements extérieur avec d'autres locataires ( Seul point négatif en ce qui nous concerne ) car les locataires ne sont pas toujours agréables . La maison est située dans un quartier résidentiel très agréable et calme . Merci Brenna

67089,319208530,2018-09-05,200264888,Amaris,I loved Brenna’s place! You have access to many amenities inside and outside the home. Brenna and her family are very friendly and awesome hosts which made the stay even better. I highly recommend staying there a few nights.
67089,321964360,2018-09-11,66127774,Jeff,This was our second time staying here and probably enjoyed it more this time.  Brenna's place is the perfect place to stay and is close to everything.   Brenna goes out of her way to make you feel welcome and comfortable.   If ever back in L.A. we will book here again.
67089,323494473,2018-09-15,184137778,Bader,"A beautiful location, very artsy. There’s a backyard too, but I didn’t have enough time to check it out. Pictures don’t do justice to how lovely the place is."
67089,326633601,2018-09-22,84283287,Sole,Brenna's place is great! a beautiful bungalow. Quiet and well decorated.
67089,327379825,2018-09-23,143413546,Melissa,"Don’t hesitate to book. Perfect for kids with the access to the fenced in yard. Cool and modern. The bed is very comfortable, tons of tv channels to watch. The full service kitchen makes it very easy to cook meals so you’re not spending all your money on eating out. I will definitely stay here again. Brenna was out of town but still make everything smooth even recommended things for us to do with a 3 year old."
217971,724414755,2021-01-15,46266734,Cindy Anne,Len sets the bar very high for Airbnb hosts. Outstanding communication and willingness to help in every way.<br/>Fantastic location. Great outdoor space. A great find!
217971,728251986,2021-01-31,73777408,Ethan,Len could not have done more to make the stay comfortable. Highly recommend visiting his place!
217971,731308884,2021-02-14,51469707,Jodi,Nice studio tucked way back in the trees! Very private feel! We heard no noise yet we’re walking distance from the beach! Excellent location! And driveway parking! Major perk! <br/>Kitchen was well stocked and made for easy breakfast in. Special touches like wine and snacks were very thoughtful! <br/>House had everything one could need including access to beach gear and bikes! <br/>Len communicated well and was available right away when needed. <br/>Nice place to stay in Santa Monica.
9140,3676763,2013-03-03,2852774,Hugo,"Wendell and Anthony are friendly and courteous hosts. The room is good and clean.<br/>Just a short walk from the Long Beach Performing Arts Center, it was very convenient  for my conference visit."
9140,3871746,2013-03-23,4933235,Nithiphat,"The place is at a perfect location in Long Beach - very convenient to everything. The room is private as you have your own access door.  Wendell is very kind. He prepared everything you may need during your stay - towels, shampoo, breakfast, etc. He showed me around the area as this is my first time in the US. He even offered me an Airport transportation!! His dogs are lovely too."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Overall,"I would really recommend this place.  \"",,,,
9140,3883911,2013-03-24,5539941,Tosca,This was my first time using AirBNB and I was a little nervous. But I am happy to report this was a great experience!! Wendell is a great house guest! Nice guy with a great place. Tech friendly - he responded to my request quickly and will text/email to accommodate check in.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The space is great. They have towels for you,a tv,and an extension plug by the bed (really though,how many times in hotels are you unplugging lamps and alarm clocks to charge your stuff!!) the bed sheets are super soft and there are tons of pillows with varying degrees of fluff. The bed says air mattress,which it technically is,but it's very comfortable.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>There is a SEPARATE entrance,which gives you so much more privacy.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The location is great- nothing is too far of a walk... If not,its just a short cab ride. Close to food and shopping.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>There is a communal bathroom situation,but it totally works. It's a large bathroom with large tub,separate shower,and peaceful bathroom. The street noises can be a bit noisy at night,but it's not bad when you close the window.,
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>Overall awesome place and I would recommend to anyone! \"",,,,,
9140,3915002,2013-03-26,300517,Jasmine,"Wendell was amazing! Great conversation and overall an excellent host! Provided the perfect breakfast and was very inviting. The loft is beautiful and very clean. The bathroom is communal and works out well. The room was clean and super cozy. Has a private entrance and the air mattress was surprisingly very comfortable. Wendell responded quickly and was very accessible. He suggested places to dine and gave clear directions. The beach is just 6 blocks away and the room is conveniently located to bars, restaurants, shopping stores and more. If you are searching for a space where you can relax, be close to the beach, that is clean, the host respects your privacy and you feel safe.. This is the place to be.  I definitely plan to book here again! Thank you."
9140,3968402,2013-03-31,1544986,Micah,"Great hosts, private room, nice location."
9140,3992832,2013-04-01,3391354,Lizeth,"My boyfriend and I loved staying here! The location was great-- close to the Blue Line Metro and a short walk to the downtown bars, restaurants and Shoreline area."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Wendell was very gracious and a fantastic host,which made us feel very comfortable. The loft has it's own entrance and is walled off,so it's still relatively private. The only thing is that it's not very sound proof which was only an issue since we came back pretty late and I kept hoping we weren't keeping our hosts awake.,,,
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>The flexible check in/ out times are a plus as well-- we would definitely recommend this listing and would love to stay there again :) \"",,,,,

9140,4278629,2013-04-23,6029838,Chris,Fantastic host. Was super helpful. Gave me the full rundown in the building and local area. Super comfy bed!
9140,4317570,2013-04-27,3543637,Charlotte,"I would definitely stay again! Wendell was a great host from carrying our luggage up the stairs to our room to providing a lovely breakfast of coffee, fresh fruit, and bagel in the morning before we left. He is a great conversationalist as well, but willing to leave you alone to do your own thing. Parking on the street wasn't too bad, and he even fed some quarters in the machine since we left a little later than planned. The bed is a comfortable sturdy air bed mattress with tons of pillows and plenty of blankets. The bathroom was shared, but we had no difficulties using it or having it available as needed. Vons and CVS are right around the corner too from his house if you forgot anything. Wendell's dogs are the cutest too!"
9140,4386553,2013-05-01,2902916,Todd,Wendell's place was nice and local to the downtown. It was very convenient for my work errands and evening social activities. Wendell is a very good host and I look forward to returning in future for trips to the Bikestation and Long Beach.

217971,737356129,2021-03-07,118733963,Dyana,"Such a great little airbnb, the owner has made this little guest house very homey.   We literally felt like we were staying at a friends house!<br/>Len provides a variety of bicycles to ride if you want.  He is centrally located so we never even got in our car (which he was awesome and let me park in his driveway) so we walked or rode the bikes everywhere.  He is very responsive and answered all our questions and made us feel very comfortable.  We honestly never saw him unless we reached out.<br/>He left a cute little welcome basket with yummy goodies and an amazing bottle of wine!<br/>As a thank you my friend and I got him a cute little beach sign to add to his adorable beach themed bathroom.  We hope he likes it!!!<br/>WE HIGHLY recommend staying with Len!!<br/>Time to hit the road and go home wish we could have stayed longer it was that awesome!"
217971,741298927,2021-03-21,154097991,Heather,"Highly recommend this place. Len is a gracious and thoughtful host, the place is fully ready, including the kitchen and wonderful bathroom."
217971,751530640,2021-04-24,11573379,Mansi,"The place is clean and just like advertised. Nice private patio area. A quick walk to the beach. Lots of beach chairs, towels, bikes to borrow. Len communicated very quickly."

67089,328603816,2018-09-26,74351433,Tash,"Brenna's place was the perfect home away from home!  The house is bright, modern & spotlessly clean.  We had the most lovely stay and having access to the hammoc, hot tub & fire table in the backyard are such a fantastic bonus! The location is central to everything which made getting around LA really easy despite the traffic.  Brenna was thoughtful enough to leave a huge list of local places to eat & visit which was incredibly helpful. We will definitely be back on our next visit!!"
67089,329391370,2018-09-28,4899756,Richard,"Beautiful home, very homely with all the mod cons. Location was great, Brenna was lovely. I highly recommend her place. Super quiet as well and a comfy bed!"

67089,331835773,2018-10-03,880821,Lesley,Such a pleasant stay!! Loved this space so much!! I will definitely return next time I’m in LA. Brenna was helpful with offering suggestions prior to & during our stay. Very convenient to come & go as we pleased. Check in / check out super easy! The hot tub was an amazing perk!! Thanks again Brenna!
67089,333755146,2018-10-07,40754480,Amy,"Well located, safe and quiet street to stay on. Bungalow is great for two, lovely big kitchen space and rain shower is fab! Lovely and clean which is important to us!<br/>Bed is low and not the comfiest, but was OK. Beware if you stay in summer as the air con machine is right next to the bed and super loud! <br/>We didnt have a chance to try out the spa pool but it looked nice."
67089,334357995,2018-10-08,7632813,Moria,Beautiful space. Feng Shui never better. Lots of love.
67089,334679895,2018-10-09,68681053,Artemio,Breanna was a great host and were first greeted by her dog Maple. She was definitely a part of her family which I admired. Breanna was great to talk too not many airbnb host takes their time to do so. The guesthouse was everything you see in her pictures but better once you book a night there. We had a baby so we couldn’t use the hot tub but maybe next time.: )
67089,335643911,2018-10-12,109211011,Jay,Very clean and beautiful place to stay

9140,4433491,2013-05-05,5600383,Ricardo,"This was my first time using air BNB and I was a little skeptical at first but I must say it was the best way to experience long beach!<br/>Wendell was very accommodating, to the point I felt like I was staying at a friends place, and even prepared fruits for breakfast!<br/>Directions/things to do or even just a little conversation, Wendell was always there to help out! <br/>Great host, highly recommended to anyone just passing through or planning to stay a little longer!"
9140,4460984,2013-05-06,199773,John,"Our plans changed last minute, and we were unable to go to Long Beach. Too bad, because we were looking forward to meeting Wendell after exchanging messages and emails."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>We can't comment on the accommodations,of course,because we didn't stay,but the communications ahead of time were perfect. Wendell could not have been nicer,and he was planning to stay up to greet us at our late arrival. How nice is that?,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>We'll be in Long Beach again for the night and we look forward to staying with Wendell. If he is half as nice in person and he is friendly and helpful in his emails,"we're in for a wonderful stay.\"",,,,

We all shared a nice Saison Farmhouse Ale, made some chicken and asparagus and were on our way. We had no issues with parking, the room was very clean and tidy. We came back late and were able to do so without interrupting anyone else's beauty sleep. We will definitely be returning! Thanks for everything Wendell!"
9140,4749187,2013-05-23,1624207,Jeffery,Wendell was a wonderful host.  His place and guest room are clean and confortable.  I especially enjoyed having morning coffees with Wendell before heading out each day.  Many thanks!  Jeff
9140,4819579,2013-05-27,2848249,Fran,"Wendell has a lovely townhouse in the heart of Long Beach - really close to the metro and two supermarkets as well as shops etc. The house is gorgeous and the room is very comfortable and large with a great bed! The breakfasts Wendell makes are amazing - it was worth staying there for these alone and his friendly chat and good tips over breakfast made us feel right at home. Also, there are beach towels, boogie boards etc. if you need to use them. Parking wasn't a problem and we managed to park in the guest spot in the secure garage for most of our stay. Would recommend anyone to stay here and would definitely stay again if in the area!"

67089,340048620,2018-10-22,8492977,Julia,Wonderful stay with Brenna. We really enjoyed our time and felt very comfy and at home. Such a cute place and close to lots of great restaurants and centrally located for doing this around the city.
67089,340667597,2018-10-24,3545317,Natalie,"Awesome space, so bright and colorful with great hosts that really make you feel welcome!"
67089,342483717,2018-10-28,98967537,Ufook,We loved the hospitality and everything about this house. Can’t wait to revisit.

67089,344081121,2018-11-02,159897677,Tyler,"From beginning to end, Brenna and her family were top-notch. Absolutely loved our stay and cannot wait to come back!"
67089,345704644,2018-11-05,16970444,Melody,"Really liked the place! It was very clean, stylish, and had everything you would need. Brenna was quick to respond and made it very easy to get in.  It had a great outdoor area to enjoy as well. I loved most that it felt safe where it was located."
9140,6228400,2013-08-04,7656570,Barb,"Wendell's place is a gorgeous, modern loft in Long Beach! Check-in was relatively easy, even though we got in very late (or very early) after visiting with family. Wendell was a great host: he was accommodating, communication was a breeze, and there was even a tray in our room with an assortment of packaged toiletries (like a hotel!). The room was very clean and it's private entrance was a huge plus. We didn't feel like we were inconveniencing Wendell when we were going in and out. The bed was very comfortable and I didn't even realize it was an air bed until the next day! The bathroom is shared, with an entrance from the hall and one from the master bedroom, but it was never a bathroom-use conflict issue. The next morning, Wendell offered us coffee or tea and showed us out when we left."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The only issues I had here were with the bathroom. Though it was extremely clean and very spacious (there's a double vanity where one side is completely clear and dedicated to guests),I really hope he fixes the seal on the shower door,because it floods the ENTIRE bathroom when you take a shower. He was aware of this but didn't let us know ahead of time and I ended up panicking the next morning,sopping up water and changing out floor mats for 10 minutes before I got dressed. Afterwards,when I told him,he said

9140,6319910,2013-08-08,3387792,Barbara,Wendell is a generous and good natured host.  My colleague and I - we are both 50+ year old women - stayed at Wendell's place while attending a conference in Long Beach.  The room is clean and quiet and everything we needed was provided.  Sharing the bathroom was easy.  I appreciated Wendell's invitation to use his kitchen as I prepared food to take with me to the conference each day.  And of course the breakfast Wendell prepared us was fantastic.  I highly recommend this place.
"<br/>\"",,,,,
9140,6420871,2013-08-12,2621637,Michelle,"Wendell was a awesome host. First off I was going to a conference in long beach and he is within 15min walking distance. At the last minute my sister decided to travel with me and she got to stay with me for no extra fee!!! When we arrived, Wendell came outside to greet us, show us parking, and carried both of our bags in (which was 4bags total!). The next morning he made us breakfast (eggs and bacon) and added a bowl of assorted fruit to the table that we could munch on. He was very nice and down to earth. The apartment was amazing! The bathroom was my favorite part since it was huge! The air mattress slept 2 people easily and even though I'm not a big fan of those beds, I fell right to sleep. Overall, I would definitely stay with Wendell in the future and recommend you to do the same!!! (He is located right near a grocery store and a Starbucks! Very convenient!)"
9140,7141551,2013-09-08,8090406,Heather,"\"My friend and I enjoyed our stay at Wendell's place.  The location was great and awesome to have free parking in this area.  The unit is nice, but may not be suited for more than a couple.  There is one air mattress in the room (one of the nicer ones - super comfortable).  Wendell was nice enough to put an extra one in there for my friend, but it was definitely a little tight.  The house itself is a little under construction, but really beautiful in certain areas.  Wendell made us a fantastic breakfast in the morning and we enjoyed our conversation with him.  We would recommend this location, but just know that the room is not completely \"\"finished\"\".\""
9140,7289492,2013-09-14,3816643,Anna,It was a pleasure staying at Wendells place. We arrived tired of driving and he welcomed us warmly and showed us his beautiful loft. His bathroom is really spacious and the flat is super tidy and clean. He prepared fruits and croissants for breakfast (thanks so much!) and we felt absolut comfortable there. I highly recommend staying at his place!
67089,348099713,2018-11-12,63627669,Faïsa,I would definately recommend this place :) Nice and clean interior and lovely owners!

67089,355385279,2018-12-03,15125382,Ellen,"I'm a fussy traveller who couldn't find one thing to complain about at Brenna's place. It's a beautifully-designed, calm, impeccably clean space with a super-comfortable bed, wonderful kitchen, great amenities (Netflix! amazing shower! yummy almonds!), and perfect host.<br/>And did I mention the adorable dog? Great find in Culver City."
67089,356596340,2018-12-08,58749866,Pia,"The bungalow is a perfect holiday home :) It’s very clean, spacious and well decorated. The check in was very easy and we also got our car easily parked to the street."
67089,358535036,2018-12-14,155977539,Matt,Would highly recommend staying here to all friends and family. Brenna was more than accommodating with all requests and she was extremely accessible throughout my stay. The apartment itself is beautiful and very comfortable.
67089,360183573,2018-12-19,144015178,Anne,"The Bungalow is the perfect place to stay wether you’re there to see the sights, visit friends, or on a business trip. It’s super clean and well decorated through the entire space and the kitchen has everything you would need to cook. Brenna and her family were incredibly hospitable and it was great meeting them! The other perfect thing about this place is how convenient it is. You are an easy walk from “downtown” Culver City with shops, restaurants, and a movie theater. If you’re looking for a place to stay in Los Angeles, look no further!"
67089,360464129,2018-12-20,220620873,Bryson,Very nice place. Would stay again.
67089,364531104,2018-12-30,1540198,Sauman,We had a great time staying in Brenna’s guesthouse. We spend our Christmas holiday with our 2.5 years old son and we found everything we needed in this nice and cozy house. And the location is perfectly convenient for us to get around town and visit museums and beaches. We highly recommend this Brenna’s guesthouse to everyone.
67089,365812831,2019-01-01,110448214,Valerie,"My husband, 8 month old daughter & I stayed here to celebrate New Years at the Burton Chace park in Marina del Rey, which was such a short drive.<br/>We loved how safe the neighborhood was, quiet and it’s location. Parking was very easy & available. <br/>Location is everything for us...the surrounding food places, grocery stores, shopping, for adventures, etc. Everything was within a 10-15 min. drive, but I assume on some days will probably be a little bit more because of LA traffic, but that’s inevitable. <br/>We were not able to do as much as we wanted to, for instance, shopping at The Grove...*sigh*...but we were able to visit the Peterson Automotive Museum. <br/>My husband was in car heaven & actually, even if you do not love cars it will still be a great time. They even have an interactive center for kids. <br/>Tip: if you AAA, you get a slight discount on tickets. <br/>Also, we had the best Peruvian food nearby which was less than 1/2 mile away..Lonzo’s Bread & Peruvian eatery.<br/>We recommend the Lomo Saltado & the Arroz con Mariscos...have been dreaming about those delicious meals...*sigh*<br/>But back to the lovely guest house..<br/>From the pictures and reviews, we knew it was going to be great but being there in person exceeded our expectations even more. <br/>It was definitely a home away from home,  a feel good place. The living area & the kitchen was amazing! I was not able to utilize the kitchen as I wanted to, but loved how fully equipped it was. <br/>The bed was comfortable, the shower was nice, the lush backyard w/the hammock & lounge area w/the fire pit was great, there were many outlets provided and the fireplace heater kept us warm during the holidays. <br/>We will definitely be back! Don’t think twice about it, book it! <br/>Thank you Brenna and family! :)"
67089,367407264,2019-01-04,50634493,Ian,"Place was clean, convenient, spacious and had a great sound system. Amenities and kitchen were excellent as well.

67089,400050257,2019-01-10,39305132,Chelsea,"Brenna’s guest house is super cute and the hot tub was great! The trees surrounding the yard gives it a nice nature feel. I would definitely stay again! The only issue I had was getting a parking ticket, but that was definitely my fault lol. Street cleanings restrict times and I’m forgetful lol!"
67089,401463608,2019-01-14,68429019,Meghna,"Brenna’s place is perfectly located in Culver City, almost equidistant from all the places we wanted to visit during our weekend there. The bed was very comfortable, and Brenna was quick to respond to all messages. We had a wonderful time, and would definitely recommend this Airbnb for a weekend trip to LA!"
9140,7297792,2013-09-14,8773931,Jon,Wendell was an excellent host. He responded very quickly to the reservation (done late at night) and opened his door to someone new to AirBnB. I am really grateful and had an excellent night's sleep.
9140,7353478,2013-09-16,4005081,Veronica,"Wendell was a great host. He was very flexible about the time we arrived. Wendell explained everything twice, once for my friend and a second time for my sister and I when we arrived. He also had waters, mini shampoos, soaps, and lotions ready for us. My friend and sister had not used airbnb and they both really enjoyed their experience, in part due to Wendell. They will now be using airbnb when they travel."
9140,7497501,2013-09-22,636464,Ken,Enjoyed my stay at Wendell's place. Wendell's unit had a private entrance  with secure underground parking. <br/>Look forward to  staying again in the future. <br/>
9140,7680306,2013-09-29,5483552,Robert,Wendell's place was perfect for us. We were 4 people. The private bed room and the spacious living room was definitely enough. We really felt like home here. Wendell was a great host. He welcomed us with a cold beer and fixed us breakfast every morning. The highlight were the waffles!  We really enjoyed our time at Wendell's place!
9140,7802065,2013-10-03,9061313,Brooklynn & John Michael,"Wendell was a very gracious host. The room was great with private access, which made slipping in and out nice. The bathroom is shared, but it was not a problem at all. Our favorite part was breakfast, we loved the croissant, egg and turkey bacon sandwiches! Also, he was able to provide a parking spot in the garage which was SUPER convenient. Thanks!!"

I had made a mistake with my dates and he graciously changed them without any charges and also set up an extra bed for a last minute friend also for no extra charge. Wendell offered us an amazing breakfast the next morning with bagels, smoked salmon, tomatoes, onions, humus, orange juice, coffee, all the works!"
"<br/>It was such a pleasure meeting him as he is a really nice independent host that has friendly conversation and also gave us all the space we needed.

The place is designed beautifully, is super quiet, and incredibly peaceful. The only minor things that we noticed were a musty smell coming from the bathroom and lots of leaves/dirt in the hot tub, other than that the place was impeccably clean and those things would not keep us from booking again!"

The thorough check-in instructions and parking pass and directions for using the outdoor lights near the hot tub were much appreciated. My group wished we had had a longer stay in order to take better advantage of the impressive kitchen and adorable outdoor spaces. We did make it into the hot tub, which was lovely.  There have unfortunately not been any innovations in futon technology that have made sleeping on one any more pleasant, but as the one in our group who volunteered to take it, I knew what I was signing up for. Thanks Brenna for an easy stay!"

<br/>We really felt like at home at Wendell's place! There was everything you could need to feel great - from kitchen to bathroom to indoors ground floor parking. It was all spacious and clean. And Wendell prepared a really delicious breakfast for the three of us - according to everybody's special wishes. As one of us was vegetarian,and Wendell didn't happen to have fresh fruit at home,he just run to a shop around the corner,came back in 5 minutes,together with a nice mix of fresh fruit!!! :D,

9140,8613004,2013-11-08,8524055,Vera,Wendells room was just right for our needs.  We were just there fora quick layover en route to Mexico.  The air beds were very comfortable and what I loved the most is that this Room had its own private entrance. Wendell was just like the other reviews mentioned very helpful and very accomodating.  His place was close and walking distance to many shops and of course the arena where we had Tickets for a show.  This is my second stay at a airbnb place and I'm just Loving the concept and you save so much$$$

Had plenty of privacy, huge room, and Wendell even had a mini-fridge in the kitchen to keep my food in. He offered me coffee every morning, and recommended different places around to visit. He lives literally right next to a grocery store and shopping area, it was very convenient to get to the free shuttle that takes you all over the Long Beach area. His place was beautiful and clean, made me feel totally comfortable."

It takes no time to walk to the beach and Len provides everything you would need for a day at the beach. The guesthouse is very clean and full of all the supplies you would want for a multi-night stay. Communication was great and Len provides a very helpful binder of information and suggestions of things to do in the area and a nice welcome basket as well. Definitely would stay again"

Hosts spared no details in ensuring you have a hassle free stay. We thoroughly enjoyed the bicycles on the property and all of the details contained in the guestbook to get around on both bike/foot. We truly enjoyed our weekend here and would absolutely return. By far one of the best airbnbs we’ve stayed at in the area. Thank you so much for the great weekend!!!"

Very clean and great details with all the amenities plus a few extras.  We used 2 of the beach bikes they are older but work just fine do the job. Len is in great communication before check in and available while you’re there. The guest house is detached and tucked into the back of the<br/>Main house and it is very quiet even with other tenants in a different guest quarters on site. There was 5 of us sleeping in close quarters and managed to still love each other at the end of our trip. Great stay and we will return!

217971,513780942263012822,2021-12-09,158968893,Patricia,"Great place to stay! Len was great! We walked to the Santa Monica Pier and rode bikes to Venice Beach, took an Uber to the Huntley Hotel to watch the sunset and To the Broad in LA. A perfect trip."

217971,536999911401645236,2022-01-10,423603305,Paige,Great location. Nice to have a parking space. Internet is iffy so use your own hotspot to connect.
217971,538472279593159937,2022-01-12,2992336,Deena,"Wait a wonderful stay at Len‘s place! We were just there to relax, and were able to very well there. I have to say, the bed was the most comfortable one I have ever slept in! There was a big tray of candy when we arrived and we ate all of it. Not that we should have! The shower is luxurious and the location is not to be beat. We walked everywhere while we were there. Our dog loved it too!"
67089,435223332,2019-04-09,8923376,Eugenia Bowman,"This is a lovely spot, and I wish we had more time to enjoy it!"
67089,438417592,2019-04-16,184478276,Wahid,Very friendly people. Perfect place to visit the LA area and get a California experience. ☀️ If you’re going to stay here try to stay as long as possible because you will not want to leave!
67089,438874742,2019-04-17,111242849,Megan,"Location was great - close to the airport and a relatively cheap uber ride's distance to restaurants and sightseeing attractions. The house is lovely, very cute, lots of special little touches, and free parking. Price was very reasonable and value is high. Communication with Brenna was lightning fast and easy and she was incredibly accommodating in allowing us to drop off our luggage before check in. Brenna is so nice and helpful with tips as well. The houekeeper was so friendly and sweet too. Would definitely recommend this location and would stay here again."
67089,440368389,2019-04-20,179259550,Aastha,"Amazing place! Great amenities, and Brenna was always very quick to respond and ensure that everything was okay. Would definitely visit again."
67089,444319084,2019-04-27,42369640,Vincent,"We liked the guest house and it got the job done. The pictures are very attractive online but in person its slightly different, you can tell it has been in use for many years. The bathroom had a slight odor and the place wasn’t  cleaned that well. This isn’t a bad place to stay, but for the price you should get more for your money."
9140,8964984,2013-11-28,3337669,Valentin,AWESOME!!!
"<br/>Wendell is a super host giving all a traveller would need! It was nice to have breakfasts while talking about America and travelling. True AirBnB experience!\"",,,,,
9140,9071881,2013-12-04,2928203,Allee,Wendell's place is conveniently located to downtown Long Beach which made it ideal for me. It was a little tricky finding the front door just using the street address so read the directions carefully and they'll lead you right where you need to go. Some of the bedroom wall surfaces are still under construction at the time of this writing but will be quite nice when finished. I was surprised when I first saw the very high-end queen-sized inflatable mattress but it was quite firm and comfortable to sleep on. The bathroom and especially the shower are VERY nice. Wendell was very nice and went out of his way to be of assistance. Thank you Wendell!
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>I recommend Wendell's place.\"",,,,,
9140,9121450,2013-12-08,1010940,Amber,"I was in Long Beach for a conference and I would recommend staying at Wendell's place for a number of reasons. One, he was extremely gracious and accommodating.  He would make breakfast each day and make sure I was all set.  He even gave me a ride to the airport when I flew out!  The room is nice and clean, has a separate entrance which makes coming/going seamless.  Bed is comfy and bathroom is really modern/spacious.  Apt is within easy walking distance to heart of Long Beach.  Again, this is a great option for those looking to save some money and stay downtown.   Thanks Wendell!"

67089,450961998,2019-05-10,587675,Hamilton,This place is a true guest house with all the amenities.  The shower was my favorite place in the house because it accommodated my 6’5 body comfortably.   10 out of 10 stars!
67089,452704794,2019-05-13,13251320,Jennifer,"We visited LA for a few days and Brenna’s guest house was just perfect!  Great local recommendations for food and lovely area to just relax after a busy day exploring the city.  Hadn’t anticipated just how big LA was but Beverly Hills, Hollywood and Venice Beach were all about a 30 min drive depending on traffic. We’d definitely look to stay here again if we come back!"
67089,454193329,2019-05-17,79994030,Carissa,"Love this place !!!! We were in LA for our honeymoon after getting married in Las Vegas and wanted a nice place to snuggle, eat, drink, and binge watch the Game of Thrones. Brenna is super sweet and her family was a warm welcome coming from Atlanta were hospitality is big. Her spot is a hidden gem and would highly recommend if you never been to California."
67089,456517386,2019-05-21,63569448,Ollie,A completely charming bungalow in a very nice area. Very easy to get around and explore from. A couple of sweet touches which made it even better. Would 100% stay again and would stay for longer next time

I could sit out there all day! The bungalow was extremely clean, and I was interior decor was very tasteful and vibrant. Bed was really comfortable. Loved the big shower! Having pots & pans, towels and toilet paper provided was a plus!! Brenna was an incredible host, SO friendly and helpful. She gave us an awesome hiking suggestion! Thank you for the great experience Brenna! We will be back!"
67089,464044141,2019-06-04,97044170,Emily,"I loved the space and since it was my first time using Airbnb, I felt safe. The backyard and the couch were my favorite part. I loved to sit in the morning with some coffee or sit outside at night with some wine as a night cap. Great spot and was really central to all the places we wanted to visit."

The location was spot on, parking a huge plus.  Wonderful little outdoors patio area.. the bikes were awesome fun.  As others have noted, the Wifi is hit or miss, but it is tucked along a beautiful lush hill- might have something to do with it, and besides visitors should be enjoying the house, location and the beach- not glued to the internet :D  HIGHLY recommend and hope to visit again soon!"
217971,579791659299339989,2022-03-10,19567764,Allison,Lovely hosts. They were very kind and sweet people and the guest house was exactly as described. They were building an outdoor patio kitchen addition which will be an amazing addition to an already beautiful patio. Will definitely stay here again if I have an opportunity to visit LA again
217971,581890739409331189,2022-03-13,446238060,Tyler,Great place to stay. Owner was nice and was able to explain the guest house. Great to allow us to park on the driveway.

It is a perfect location - very close to the beach, quiet, and central between Malibu and Santa Monica while still being in walking distance (1-1.5 miles) a lot of the main Santa Monica attractions. The guest house itself is fully stocked with beach necessities (e.g., big beach towels) and has all the little things you need if you want to cook while you stay (pots and pans, salt and pepper, etc.). Len was amazingly helpful and responsive as well! Would definitely stay again"

9140,9834716,2014-01-13,10718274,Angelica,Wendell was such a wonderful host! I think this is a great place to stay in and great location. He made us feel very comfortable at his loft and provided us with coffee the two mornings we were there. I agree that the door next to the room gave us easy access/exit from the loft to the outside. The bathroom was amazing and we had our own sink. I would recommend Wendell to anyone! He is a great person to talk to as well. :)
9140,9872266,2014-01-15,6278540,Louie,My go to place to stay in long beach . Great location great apt Wendell is very sweet!
9140,9914184,2014-01-19,10282437,Gerald,"Wendell was great and the location was great. The listing didn't mention that his location is 1/2 block away from a Red bus stop and that you can ride the red bus anywhere downtown Long Beach for no cost. This worked out great as I went to the waterfront for dinner and used it to ride to the convention center as well. Great loft, very friendly host. I would highly recommend."
9140,9978636,2014-01-22,11216940,Aldy,Staying with Wendell was a great experience!  He was a great guy to talk with and he also cooked a pretty mean breakfast!  He even drove me to the airport and we were talking all the way.
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Overall,I definitely recommend him over any other lodging options in Long Beach.  His place is not only located in the core of the city,but also it has a shopping mall right behind it that Starbucks is literally in his backyard.  (Of course Wendell also makes a pretty mean coffee so it's kind of redundant)  For me who flew in to Long Beach,"this was almost godsend.\"",,
9140,10198765,2014-02-05,11526351,Michael,Wendell is a very kind and gracious host with a very comfortable room. Everything needed was provided and the home was very quiet the whole time. If you're staying in Long Bch for any amount of time I highly recommend Wendell's loft - quality stuff!
9140,10277407,2014-02-10,11742808,Kyle,"This place was great. Wendell is such an accommodating and considerate host. He had bottles of water in the room, gave us a tour of her place, had shower amenities, offered coffee and fruit in the morning. The location can't be beat and the room has it's own private access, so you don't have to worry about coming in late and disturbing anyone. Overall it was a great experience and a really good price."
9140,10350000,2014-02-15,7219179,Kevin,"Wendel provided excellent accommodations during our four day stay. The room had a private  keyed entrance off an outdoor corridor on the second floor of the building. The bathroom, although shared, was very spacious and always available. The shower was large and roomy and the w.c. had a separate enclosure. Wendel generously offered coffee and fruit in the morning for a pleasant send-off. The basement parking garage was a big help since we had a rental car and prefered not parking it on the street. There is an elevator as well as stairs to the garage. Public transit was also available near-by. The two little dogs in the household gave it a homey feel. We spent most of our time visiting family in the area and we can highly recommend Wendel's accommodations."

Wendell waited up for us, and was very flexible in allowing us to leave our stuff while getting the bikes fixed. We had a great time, enjoying his company and that of the rescued turtle in his aquarium. The condo has high ceilings, feeling even more spacious. The description says airbed. It's a most deluxe, warm, full-height airbed with headboard. Very comfy. The secure gated underground parking was a big plus for us. Wonderful experience."
9140,10577233,2014-02-25,9999925,Mike,Great experience.  Wendell is a friendly and fascinating host.  Liked having both a private entry and secure parking and located in the heart of town.

So conveniently located to great places in Long Beach including excellent dining options, Pine Avenue, Shoreline, etc. Underground parking big plus!!! Thanks for the morning caffeine fix and offers for light breakfast. The water and other amenities in the room were also appreciated. Enjoyed sharing my time with your pets.

9140,10924338,2014-03-13,11634000,Da,My stay at Wendell's was great! He was an excellent host and a pleasant conversationalist. The room and bathroom was clean upon arrival with plenty of towels. Wendell was also nice enough to set up another air mattress for a friend that joined last minute. I will stay at Wendell's again the next time I'm in the area.
9140,11762431,2014-04-14,12256131,Yun-Ping,"We just had a short time there and we spoke poor English, but Wendell still paid patient to tell us where to go having some fun and French dinner.  Long beach has different atmosphere then other places in LA, we'll be back!"

9140,13026109,2014-05-17,100992,Laurie & Tony,"Our stay with Wendell was amazing!! Our experience was a little unusual/unconventional as we live about a mile from Wendell. We were in need of a place to stay to get a little reprieve from the extreme heatwave we were experiencing. Our place is a quaint, 1920's place that unfortunately does not have a/c as we depend on the ocean breeze. Our request was last minute and Wendell responded and accepted immediately. His place is to die for. We loved the modern space, it was very clean and they were so very pleasant. The actual bedroom was spacious and private. It even has its own entrance and Wendell was very generous in giving us his secured/garage parking space. We would definitely recommend Wendell ' s spot!! We are so appreciative that he saved us from the heat. Thanks!!"

67089,532435030,2019-09-19,20824029,Gianna,"I needed somewhere to stay for the night, very last min. I think we booked around 7:39/7:45 that evening. Brenna was totally  available via the app, text and email so that I could confirm, prior to booking, that the last min scheduling wouldn’t be an issue. <br/>Her back house is gorgeous! It has private entry and access to all of the backyard amenities: hot tub, water fountain, tree house with slide and two different areas with outdoor seating. The back house has a fully stocked restroom, bedroom and kitchen/living area. It is quaint and gorgeously decorated! It was perfect for my three year old niece and me. <br/>We loved being able to meet Brenna and her two adorable young children and very friendly dog. We live in the area and it was nice to have a quick getaway! <br/>She’s very near downtown Culver City which is great for food, activities and nightlife. She is also just a short drive/Uber from Santa Monica, Venice, Downtown LA and more! Culver City is a GREAT central, yet quiet, location for people looking to experience all of the many things LA has to offer. <br/>We will def be back! Thank you!!!"
67089,534603806,2019-09-22,47630962,George,"A fantastic stay, huge thanks to Brenna and Charlie for their fantastic hospitality! <br/>We had a great time, made easier by superb information both in regards to check in and things to do locally!"
67089,540058705,2019-10-02,124319550,Crystal,"Loved staying here! It was super cute and everything was super instagrammable. The neighborhood is also super safe so you can leave your car parked on the street and it’s perfectly safe. Interior was amazing and even the outside was so cute! It’s a very friendly and good vibe place! I’ve stayed all around LA, and this was one of the best if not the best place Airbnb I’ve stayed."
67089,540542566,2019-10-03,69428463,John,"Great little spot. A hidden bungalow. I wish we could have stayed for a few more days and enjoyed all the amenities. I’ll be back for the jacuzzi, I swear!!!"
67089,541734911,2019-10-05,243432248,Daniel,"Wir waren zu dritt in Brenna‘s Unterkunft und haben uns von der ersten Minute an wohl gefühlt.<br/>Die Unterkunft war sehr sauber und die Info‘s wo man in der Umgebung einkaufen uns Essen kann, haben uns , an unserem ersten Tag sehr geholfen.<br/>Wir können diese Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen."

67089,564046509,2019-11-14,19744053,Kelly,"3 1/2 guests stayed for 5 nights - my husband, our 1.5 yr old, my mother and I. My mother slept on the futon, and it was good enough. The bed linens were very soft and comfortable. The garden space is what made us choose it and we were very happy we did. We spent a lot of time enjoying the garden, they have a friendly little dog who my daughter enjoyed playing with and the hosts are lovely people."
67089,564859558,2019-11-16,161913513,Hassan,The best place to stay in LA! Definitely gonna stay here every time i visit. The friendliest and welcoming hosts ever. The place was super clean and had more than one could ever expect. Very safe neighbourhood.
67089,566546999,2019-11-19,74004232,Marissa,"You will not regret staying here! The guesthouse is so cozy & clean and the backyard area is the epitome of good vibes. It’s in a nice neighborhood that is centrally located so you’re not far from Santa Monica, Venice Beach, Hollywood, downtown LA, etc. Brenna and Charlie are very cool/sweet people. They provide everything you need as far as amenities, a parking permit, folders full of recommendations and checkin/checkout instructions. This was my first airbnb experience and boy did they set the bar high ☺️ Will 100% stay here again next time I come out to LA!"
67089,569543093,2019-11-26,34516149,Megan,"Brenna’s space was clean, comfortable and had everything we needed for our 6 night stay. Parking was easy and convenient. Brenna was super friendly and welcoming. Would not hesitate to stay again."
67089,572015440,2019-12-01,152899905,Stephanie,"This place is awesome.  Location is central to a lot of what LA has to offer. The actual guest house is perfect, everything you could need and want.  The weather was a bit chilly during our trip and I was so relieved that this<br/>Location had a heater, which really came in handy for us.  I would definitely stay again."
67089,574008528,2019-12-07,64476701,Ellen,Brenna was very accommodating to us and was very helpful in connecting me with her alterations shop that fixed my dress in 24 hours!
67089,576213854,2019-12-12,29503042,Naomi,"Fantastic bungalow, very clean and stylish with everything you could need for a comfortable and luxurious stay. The hot tub and fire pit were amazing to use and made me feel super relaxed. It was a little oasis in the midst of a busy city. The place was well hidden and felt like a quiet island resort. It was very central and close to all attractions and downtown LA. Very happy with this place and will definitely stay here again."
67089,577625720,2019-12-15,16469379,Stephanie,"This little nook is a perfect home base to stay. As much as we love Brenda and her family, we should note if you wanted to use the hot tub naked this might not be the place. I never asked, but we were cautious because there’s kids nearby. <br/>Regardless I highly recommend this place for a fun stay in LA. The host was incredibly gracious and very hospitable. My girlfriends and I had a lovely time."
67089,578174237,2019-12-16,208532447,Alan,Amazing guesthouse in the heart of the one of the best neighborhoods in LA. My family and I stayed here for one night to take a break during our week long vacation and really enjoyed the space and hot tub. Highly recommended if it's available and not booked up already!

217971,721803983992043914,2022-09-22,239469270,Marcus,We cannot recommend this property highly enough.<br/>Len and Jan are the best of hosts with a lovely welcome pack provided upon arrival.<br/>The guest house is furnished to a good standard with additional provisions provided in the fridge.<br/>The house is just a 5 minute walk to the beach which is accessed by a tunnel underneath the road.<br/>Please consider booking this property.
217971,737786103160740909,2022-10-14,454694819,Elsa,"Perfect spot, close to the beach, great hosts, and wonderfully maintained and stocked."

9140,13484630,2014-05-28,4669698,Sarah,"Wendell's place was absolutely perfect. He was willing to check me in around 10PM, and went over everything that I would need to know about the apartment and the area in great detail. There was a private entrance to the room, which I enjoyed, as I could have the freedom to come back whatever time I wanted without disturbing my hosts. Wendell provided small touches that really went a long way: bottled water in the closet of the room, a bowl of soaps and lotions, and even had an iron and ironing board there for me to use. There was secure parking in a garage, and the entire place was very safe.<br/>The location is superb: there are many restaurants and shops within walking distance (a very tasty vegan café is across the street for any plant-based travelers looking at staying in Long Beach) and the area is a great place to run or take a scenic walk.<br/>All in all, an excellent rental and a fabulous stay!<br/>"
9140,13806597,2014-06-04,15623673,Maggie,"Great place! Close to everything, and Wendell is a  very nice and detailed person. Dogs are cute : ) 25min to Disney and 35min to Hollywood. Air beds are good, too."
9140,13967066,2014-06-09,4333658,Dwayne,"This is our third time staying here and it won't be our last. Anytime we travel to Long Beach, this is the go to spot."
9140,14108282,2014-06-11,11921933,Moses,"Had a great experience, very satisfied."
9140,14133731,2014-06-12,8639826,Hannah,"Our stay with Wendell was simply wonderful! My friend Chrissi and I set out on a trip down the West Coast starting in Seattle and by the time we had made it to Long Beach we were so thankful to find ourself in a clean, comfortable, and super accommodating place. Wendell greeted us outside his home and brought us to the parking garage (which was awesome!). His place is beautiful and the room we stayed in had its own private entrance. Wendell gave us some recommendations for dinner which we simply walked to and the next morning he had breakfast all set out and ready for us. His roommate, Anthony, and their two dogs were welcoming as well! The next day we walked around Long Beach's cute shops as well as along the beach. I would highly recommend staying here!"
9140,14370613,2014-06-17,16135816,Tiana,Great location right across from Berlin bistro and a very comfy bed! Wendell had everything you could need for the night and was very welcoming.
9140,14574655,2014-06-22,1528037,Helen,"I stayed at Wendell's place for 3 nights while attending a conference in Long Beach. The location was excellent as it was walking distance to the conference location and restaurants. The reserved underground parking space was also perfect. Wendell had yogurt parfaits and tea ready for me for breakfast every day which was nice. He also had water bottles and amenities like soap/shampoo/conditioner ready for me to use in the room, and even a hair dryer which was greatly appreciated."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>However,there were a few things that were not ideal. The shower door/walls are not sealed properly so it's very easy for the water to leak out and flood the bathroom when you take a shower. I ended up having to shower as close as possible to the front wall where the shower head is located and make sure the shower head was not pointing outwards to be extra careful. Also,"I tend to like firmer beds so the airbed was not very comfortable for me. The first night was quite hot and there were some mosquitoes that might have come in through the window screen into the room but the next day Wendell turned on the air conditioning and closed the window before I came back to sleep and it was a lot better.  \"",,,
9140,14835479,2014-06-27,7630776,Denise,My stay at Wendell's place was great.  He is a kind and considerate host.  He met me on time and offers a private space with many amenities.  The bed was very comfortable and the private entry made it easy to come and go.  I was treated to a nice breakfast each morning and enjoyed our conversations over coffee.  I would definitely stay again.  Thanks for the great hospitality Wendell!
9140,15161465,2014-07-03,6584070,Ivan,"\"We spent a lovely time at Wendell's place. He was such a nice host, he provided us with all we needed and much more (ie. two beach towels, a beautiful bottle of wine, nice snacks, freshly brewed coffee and so on). Every morning he would set the table for breakfast so when we woke up it was all ready for us - we really appreciated the fruit and yogurt, after two weeks on the road it was nice to begin the day with some \"\"clean food\"\".<br/>The room is bigger than it appears in pictures"
9140,15426159,2014-07-08,17274156,Tatiana,"When we arrived at Wendell's home we were greeted and given all of the necessary information to make our stay enjoyable. The property was just as beautiful as the photographs and Wendell was more then accommodating with the random questions we asked. The beach was in walking distance and easy to locate! The bed  and furnishings were amazingly comfortable, I woke up feeling refreshed like I had slept on a cloud. I have no complaints, I truly enjoyed my stay and if I find myself in Long Beach in the future, Wendell's will be at the top of the list for places to stay."
9140,15596060,2014-07-12,17222723,Michael,"Very very very nice host! Very convenient neighborhood. The decorations in the house is very beautiful and artistic that u will surely have an awesome sleeping here!! Wendell is super hospitable. He spent a lot of time fixing the bike for us,and provided us great breakfast with any coffee u want!!!<br/>All the living place is filled with fruit scent!<br/>We did have a great time here.<br/>I think where u live do affect the quality of ur trip, so I highly recommend Wendell's place when u come to Long Beach"
217971,746416802235808497,2022-10-26,5569264,Éloïse,"Emplacement idéal, à distance de marche de la plage et d'un resto fort sympathique au coin de la rue (Patrick's roadhouse). Accueil très chaleureux de Len. <br/>Lit confortable. Tout le nécessaire y est dans cette mini-maison.<br/>Seul petit inconvénient (qui peut être agaçant si vous n'avez pas de réseau sur votre téléphone et avez besoin du wifi), le wifi est TRÈS lent, des fois inexistant."
217971,759547963483217546,2022-11-13,24122553,Ciara,"Len and Jan were so wonderful!

217971,807393477286431366,2023-01-18,147207459,Carli,We loved our stays at Len’s place. <br/>Location was excellent as we wanted to stay by the water but away from the hotels and crowds. <br/>Really cute neighborhood and very accommodating host. <br/>We would stay here again next time we come back to LA!
217971,810253786792564259,2023-01-22,113649807,Nathan,"Had a great time staying here. Perfect spot if you want a quiet place in LA, close to great hiking and excellent food. Len is super-responsive and helpful. Will definitely visit here again next time we are in LA."
217971,819018801099433805,2023-02-03,140805114,Sean,"Absolutely brilliant place to stay, Len and Jan are fabulous hosts and made us feel very welcome in their guesthouse! With a welcome basket on arrival and a friendly recommendation of local restaurants, I can't highlight enough how much of a positive experience they made this.<br/>Additionally, the room is exactly as advertised. It's in a lovely area with plenty to do, the room was clean and well maintained, and the amenities available were fantastic.<br/>Thank you Len and Jan for making our stay most comfortable!"

217971,834211887015252194,2023-02-24,355712170,Leah,"Len’s place is defiantly one of the best place in Santa Monica. Tidy, close to beach. Beside the bed and sofa bed, there are two more mattresses in the attic ( though the place is a little small). Over all, that was a awesome staying experience."
217971,836351132241185423,2023-02-27,218850773,Brian,I stayed with my two sons for a long weekend before they marry and we were able to use the bicycles on site to get around Santa Monica with these. The location was great and the spot was great for the three of us.
217971,892084321172800978,2023-05-15,110863703,Paige,"What a wonderful guesthouse in such a perfect location! Highly recommend Len's place. The location is wonderful, walking distance to beach and restaurants while at the same time being quiet and peaceful. The outdoor space is beautiful and very well done. The guesthouse has everything you might need and lots of helpful instructions on how things work. Len also provides beach gear and bikes you can borrow . Really a top of the line Airbhb. Len was also super friendly and helpful making us feel right at home. We had packed up my daughter's dorm room and had all her things in the car. Len graciously allowed us to park in his driveway so we felt everything was very safe and secure. Will definitely stay again!"

217971,897969223292165866,2023-05-23,133705626,Elizabeth,"The hosts were nice. The place was clean, and they provided a binder with information of local spots. It did smell musty inside and is very small. Good if you are a small family, but I wouldn’t recommend for friends. We chose this place for location, reviews, and the hot tub. However, we were told the other tenant gets first dibs on it which we were unaware of. This guest spot is located in backyard of the host’s home and another rented spot. The bathroom was very nice and renovated nicely."
217971,907396869837956186,2023-06-05,202869349,Natalia,Len and his family are fantastic hosts and just great people! Highly recommend staying with them if you can :)
67089,585546302,2019-12-31,3852370,Cassandre,This place was perfect in every way! We came here with a child who slept on the futon while we were sleeping in the closed bedroom. The shared places were spotless and very well made for a perfect stay. Every things was as described and Brenna answered our questions very fast and always very kindly. The area is perfect for families and is near everything we needed. I highly recommend!
67089,587257234,2020-01-02,21700416,Jenna,Great spot to stay in Culver City! The guest cottage is so cozy and has everything you need. I loved being able to see the outdoor garden area as well.

67089,592329023,2020-01-12,5838475,Susan,Brenna's bungalow was a perfect weekend getaway. The home is in Culver City and close to all of the great restaurants and bars. A few things that I loved: the hot tub on a chilly night; vibrant living space; the rain shower head in the shower; comfy bed; grrreat communication!

9140,17493284,2014-08-12,9310609,Brenna,"Nice place. Only stayed 1 night but it was private, clean, comfortable and convenient. Wendell is very nice and I appreciated the coffee and yogurt in the morning!"
9140,17832434,2014-08-18,16706268,Rosanne & Laurence,"After a several days' drive from Austin, TX we were welcomed to Wendell's airbnb in grand style.  Everything was first class--the room was spacious with a private entrance.  The breakfasts were well suited to our preferences and style of eating--healthy!  We were attending the Shaklee Global Conference, and it was great to have an enclosed space for our car to sleep at no additional cost. The address was close enough to the convention center for me to walk to the conference. My wife and I enjoyed sharing several conversations during our stay and would welcome the opportunity to return in the future."
9140,18101605,2014-08-21,19062214,Andreas,"Would recommend staying at wendell and team. The room was just like the picture, and with your own entrees. All in all a very nice stay."
9140,18159713,2014-08-22,18225398,Sal,Wendell was a great host and new so much about Long Beach.  His place has an interesting layout that reminded you of something you might see in New York.  Very cool.  I greatly appreciated that he took my reservation on short notice as last minute client request keep me out of town more than I usually plan for.  I would highly recommend his place to anyone looking for a clean and comfortable stay.

67089,597505973,2020-01-25,136206932,Kimberly,"I was drawn to Culver City due to the close proximity to the Getty Center and LAX. Brenna went above and beyond to relay highlights and helpful hints of LA and surrounding area before we even arrived. The space is beautifully decorated, well appointed and spotless. What a treat to come back to the tranquil enclave after sightseeing and commuting in LA traffic. The shared outdoor space was inviting and landscaped. Allocated parking space was convenient. Highly recommend Brenna’s place!"
67089,598155680,2020-01-26,6960340,Dede,So thoughtfully decorated and I appreciated the degree of communication.  Such a cute and safe neighborhood; so close to enough cute restaurants and bars.  <br/>I was in LA for 24 hours and this was the perfect getaway.
67089,599331767,2020-01-29,8310961,Sandy,"\"We enjoyed our stay so much, that we can't wait to come back and stay in this<br/>amazing bungalow again.  It is an oasis from the fast pace of LA, and provided us a place to catch our breath, relax, and enjoy the hip vibe of Culver City when we would venture out in the community.  Grocery stores, fast food, freeway access, boutique bakeries, restaurants, and Sony Studios, are just a few of the things that make Culver City so great. The decor inside and outside our accomodations was \"\"cool\"\" and functional!  Brenna was an excellent host that met every one of our needs"
67089,601147401,2020-02-02,14296480,Christina,Great location and a comfortable stay at the bungalow. Would definitely stay again.

Her guesthouse is in an awesome location - centrally located to all things in LA and walkable to restaurants, coffee and grocery stores. Brenna gave us great suggestions and was very helpful answering any questions we had about the area. Would definitely stay here again when we come back to La!"

221502,973714,2012-03-05,1727876,David,Grant was a great host. My flight got delayed and ended up arriving to LA around 500 am and Grant was still awake waiting for me. Grant was really helpful and really knowledgeable about LA. He was very nice and accommodating. Will come back and see him again. Thanks for everything Grant!
221502,1776539,2012-07-23,767745,Edward,"COMFORTABLE, ENJOYABLE, CONVINIENT, PRIVATE."
221502,1988517,2012-08-14,821450,Sheryaar,"Grant was receptive and accomodating. He spent plenty of time explaining directions to his place, as well as staying up quite a bit later than originally planned due to flight delays. Unfortunately, Grant was out for most of the weekend so I can't comment much further on the host. The place itself was roomy and comfortable. Although all of the furniture is quite old, I never got the impression that any of it was dirty. There is no A.C. so expect to rely on fans. From what I understand, however, I was a bit unlucky in how hot it was when I arrived - no A.C. may not actually be a problem on most days in L.A.. There IS internet, although it isn't listed under amneties. The lack of A.C. was the only thing that made my experience slightly uncomfortable, other than that, the digs were solid."
9140,18431933,2014-08-26,18397247,Carolina,Wendell made us feel very at home and comfortable. He always had breakfast ready for us and he even had a mini fridge where we were able to store food. The loft was extremely clean and fresh. The neighborhood was beautiful and I would definitely recommend this loft to anyone.
9140,18816378,2014-09-01,13384341,Suzy,"As this was my first Airbnb stay, I have to say it turned out to be a great and positive experience.  Wendell is a great host, I even arrived few hours after my planned notice (due to a 2 1/2 hour rental car fiasco), and he politely let me in and showed me around.  The room was lovely, it was also a plus to have your own entrance to come and go as you please.  Only issue was on the third day of my stay, the air conditioner was turned up high for some reason and was kept on all night so it made it really chilly and uncomfortable in the room.  But I used an extra blanket and bundled up so it wasn't too bad.  Otherwise, I think I would of caught a cold!  There are also other amenities that Wendell provides such as soap, shampoo, tv with cable in the room, coffee and yogurt offered in the kitchen, and more.  I had not known about the breakfast that Wendell is so famous for, until I read the other reviews today.  But that is alright since I do not eat breakfast!  I know, so bad.  His place is really homely and comfy.  I also liked the fact that there was lots of privacy, since I mainly traveled to attend an info session at school, and needed to study every other chance I had, so it was nice to have privacy to study.  The complex was peaceful and quiet, I also really liked that parking was provided and that it was only a short walk from your room down a flight of stairs to go back to your car.  Great accommodations!  If you like peace and privacy, I say go for it!"
9140,18952669,2014-09-03,13279956,Stephen,"Wendell was an excellent host. The place was amazing. First of all the room was gorgeous and perfectly air conditioned. We loved the private entrance also. The free bikes and body boards were such a bonus, although unfortunately we didn't have enough time to take full advantage of them. There was also a convenient garage for our car. The bathroom was great, with 2 sinks and a massive walk-in shower. Wendell provided us with waffles the first morning and granola yogurts and coffee the next. One of my favorite stays so far on air bnb."
9140,19017985,2014-09-04,2120205,WhiteLinenHomesMountainView,"Wendel was a lovely and considerate host.   He had coffee and breakfast ready for us very early as I had an early flight, which was much appreciated.   He stayed up late to let us in.   His loft is beautiful with luxury finishes and was so spacious and comfortable!  The room is huge!!!   The bed was nice and stayed firm (even though an aerobed).  Clean linens.  A+ experience!  A great value on top of all this, highly recommend!"
9140,19059616,2014-09-05,19060455,Nicolette,Our stay with Wendell & Team Johnson was very brief but super enjoyable. Great room stocked with amenities and our own private entrance made the whole thing very accommodating.
9140,19469958,2014-09-13,17902825,David,Wendel was very helpful.
9140,19681034,2014-09-16,16710422,Valerie,I had a brief but pleasant stay at Wendell's place. It was nice that there was a separate entrance to the room. He also prepared breakfast and made sure i had everything i needed.
9140,19847199,2014-09-19,1940856,Barbara,"Enjoyed my stay in Long Beach and Wendell was a great host. The room was lovely with it's own entrance, a comfortable bed and access to a nice bathroom. The place also comes with a parking spot and you can borrow two bikes, perfect! The location was excellent for exploring the downtown area, for record lovers there's Fingerprints Music across the street, there's cafes and restaurants in the area and try the Congregation Ale House for the best selection of local beers."
9140,20031161,2014-09-22,6201533,Oli,"This was by far the best arbnb experience I've had. Wendell was extremely accommodating and pleasant. The separate door made it feel really comfortable to come and go as we pleased. The air mattress and sheets were very comfortable. Other highlights include the bikes on hand - they made it really easy to get around Long Beach and see the sights, the complimentary breakfast and coffee and the amazing shower/bathroom. I plan to recommend his place to all my friends and family who travel to Long Beach."
9140,20241641,2014-09-26,19600469,Yujia,"Just love this airbnb house. It's so big, bigger than my expect, also,it's very clean. Wendell & Team are so friendly, nice. <br/>房东人很好，家里面有2只狗一只乌龟。房子很干净，在小区里，位置也挺好找的。但是离机场较远，打的要80刀左右，建议坐公交的人不要选择此处。"
221502,2875580,2012-11-13,767745,Edward,"Grant is a gracious and personable host. Accomodates arrivals, departures, and needs. His apartment is a restful and commodious retreat in the city. Thick walls insure privacy. I would stay again.  Edward"
221502,3650619,2013-02-27,4984302,Ting,nice room. you get a lot of privacy and the public space are always kept very clean. william is a gracious host and helpful. great experience.
221502,3896681,2013-03-25,1753794,Ashish,"The room is large, spacious, quite and a good value.  The apartment is well apportioned and furnished with thousands of books.  Included garage parking was useful.  After confirming the reservation we couldn't get a hold of Grant and never met him, our host was William. We made the reservation for three people from the very beginning but William made it seem like an imposition.  The fold out bed was full of sunflower seeds and other suspicious materials, making it less than desirable to sleep on.  The room need a through cleaning with an attention to detail.  We would look into alternative places to stay instead of staying there again."
221502,4688828,2013-05-20,6084497,Annalisa,"This my second airbnb experience. I was very worried due to my first airbnb experience, so I asked a lot of question.  Grant is very generous, nice and patient honest. Grant was not at home very much but his housemate William also helped me a lot!<br/>The house is well-located in a safe area, and also close to the subway and bus stations, markets. I really enjoyed the stay in Grant's. <br/>The nice kitchen with good equipment and space, helped me  a lot to resolve my cuisine issue, so I can cook every night. Grant, William, Anthony and I had a wonderful dinner together. They are all nice people,and I want to thank them for everything. <br/>The bedroom has a big closet and I really love it, the bed is also comfortable. I enjoyed a lot of privacy. I will highly recommend to stay in Grant's house. If I will come to LA again, Grant 's is definitely my first choice. <br/>Again,  it's nice house and with nice people:)"
221502,6453855,2013-08-13,5417425,Tracy,"I couldn't have asked for such a pleasant stay!! I lived here for almost 3 months and have no complaints at all. It's a very private area and the hosts are extremely nice and helpful. Also, the room I stayed included a separate bathroom and dressing table and mirror which was a happy surprise! I would highly recommend this place to stay!!! Great location as well. Parking is very secure, you have your own garage in an already gated area. Two thumbs up!!"
221502,7941828,2013-10-09,7724594,Greg,"Grant and Bill are such welcoming and generous hosts. The place is private, very spacious and in prime location, walking distance to places to eat, the subway, banks etc. Having spent 1,5 months there, I can safely say this is a good one!"
221502,8330203,2013-10-26,767745,Edward,"This is my third stay with Grant Barnes. I had a wonderful spacious, attractive, light filled room with a view. The bed is large and comfortable.There is a sitting area with a comfortable sofa and oversized arm chair as well. Lamps are well situated, making for a soft atmosphere. The bathroom is large with a vanity and big, soft towels. The room is a private, quite, relaxing place to return to, after a busy day in the city, a retreat. The apartment is mid town convenient to buses and subways. If you need assistance, Bill is there to answer questions and make good suggestions. He helped"

The apartment is the nicest apartment of all I´ve seen in LA, the building is a very nice old building and the room is very spacious and has everything you need. And Koreatown is great and very close to everything!"
221502,9392585,2013-12-26,2314685,Jenny,"My stay at Grant´s place in Koreatown was great. Both the flat and the area are amazing, the room was huge and I had lots of privacy, with my own bathroom and the room being at the end of the hall in the upstairs floor of the flat. The location is great and is extremely good for public transit (for LA), as there is the subway and several bus lines. Grant was extremely helpful and accommodating."

221502,13777992,2014-06-04,1884498,Mariia,"This is my first Airbnb experience. Grant and Bill were welcoming and generous hosts. Grant met me at the airport when I arrived so I had no trouble to find the location (considering my poor English).  It was so kind of him. Also I'm thankful for late check-out (my flight back home was in the evening and I stayed up to 6pm without additional charge). The room was huge with my own bathroom and deck at the second floor of the flat . I had a lots of privacy there. I felt the lack of air conditioner only few days when the temperature was extremely high (about 100F, almost +40C)."

Brenna is very lovely, and we totally understand why she is a SUPER host! Very available, welcoming and approachable. We sure wished we could have stayed longer. It was a shame the weather was not very nice at all, as well as the coronavirus pandemic, we needed to get home. Thank you for your kind hospitality and hope to be back again in the future."

The location itself is very cute and trendy.

The place was very cute and clean and in a nice, safe neighborhood! The backyard area is shared with her family but they were so respectful of my privacy so it was never an issue at all. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
67089,624162424,2020-05-07,30780781,Janelle,"Brenna, Charlie and family were lovely. When I wanted to turn on the twinkle lights in the backyard, I sent a message through Airbnb to Brenna but she called me for a more immediate response which I really appreciated. <br/>Very chill, didn’t mind the shared backyard. Loved the design of their place esp the folding doors of the guesthouse which open so you can actually feel like you are inside and outside at the same time. The smell of the jasmine flowers were also a delightful detail, and it was great to use the fire pit at night, sip cocktails and chill on the patio. Hot tub and hammock were also enjoyed! The bed was like a cloud, the shower pressure fantastic, everything you could want in a place to stay. Would give six stars if I could! Thanks guys. 😊"
9140,20846336,2014-10-06,2179188,Sadaya,"Wendall and Team are bar none the BEST at hosting! GREAT place! Our room was SPOTLESS and COMFORTABLE....everything was BEAUTIFUL and INTERESTING. This is the art district of Long Beach so the waterfront, restaurants, shopping and more is all within walking distance. Wendall was kind to offer us some valuable transportation along with loaning us his BIKES which made the trip to THE WATERFRONT and convention center fun. Like organic food the FRESH & EASY is closeby, local coffee spot and vegan food. The deluxe airbed as SUPER COMFORTABLE...REALLY! Wendall's pets made me feel right at home, I loved my breafast yogurt, good coffee, conversation and great recommendations. I felt like a friend and am looking forward to staying in touch. STAY HERE YOU WILL LOVE IT."

67089,627708387,2020-06-04,85981428,Cindy,I traveled from Missouri to visit my daughter and her family looking to help them with childcare. This bungalow provided a sanctuary of sort for my 18 month old granddaughter and I to spend cherished time together just blocks from my daughter’s home. What a gift Brenna has provided for travelers - especially during this time of unrest. I felt safe and cared for. We will be back!
67089,628363650,2020-06-07,136515104,Savannah,"Wow!  This Airbnb was SO perfect for our girls weekend!  Brenna was super easy to communicate with and was very prompt answering any questions I had leading up to/during our stay.  We took full advantage of the kitchen and easily cooked all our meals there, made use of the hot tub and fire pit area in the evenings and was able to get to Santa Monica beach within 15min.  Everything was VERY clean and well thought out.  The bed was very comfortable and the girl that slept on the couch easily folded it down into a bed and slept great as well!  The bathroom shower was amazing and the entire place was up to date and decorated so cute.  The landscaping and yard was perfect, well kept and gorgeous!  We never heard traffic or noise from the street, super peaceful. I already have friends requesting information about this Airbnb and I will be highly recommending it to them :). Thank you so much Brenna for providing a perfect California stay."

Two things that other guests may need you know....the backyard is shared with the Airbnb guests from the other house on the property. This means the fire pit, hammock and hot tub. Just takes a bit of coordination. Also, parking is on the street. Plenty of places to park just be mindful that cars have to be moved to other side of street on certain days. The place itself is great!  Very comfortable and clean. We really enjoyed our stay."

67089,635990592,2020-07-08,5088942,Kali,Nice spot and the deck was very inviting
67089,636594078,2020-07-10,15837595,Oriana,"What a beautiful guest house! Brenna's place is located on a large but quiet street with easy parking, and even easier access to everything Culver City has to offer, as well as easy access to the freeway. The decor is wonderful - we actually booked this place based on the photos and pop of color on the walls and kitchen island, and it didn't disappoint. One of the major pluses was the full kitchen. It was great to be able to make full meals, especially during COVID times. The jacuzzi was also a nice bonus. We loved it so much we asked if we could stay longer, but, unsurprisingly, it was booked. Would definitely stay again! Thanks, Brenna!"

Grant was really helpful during these days. Also I got a really big room and separate bathroom. It is very private. And the location of this house is so convenient to bus stops, Wilshire, subway station and supermarkets in korean town within walking distance. Highly recommend those travelers who are not driving to live here!"

221502,24392392,2014-12-27,11244612,Sunny,"It is wonderful staying at Grant's house. The room is big and comfortable, the location is awsome. As my friend and I don't have car, the placa is surrounded by many good korean food and thai food also. It is pretty near to the Metro station as well. We've been stayed here for three days, and we would absolutely stay at his if we come back to L.A. <br/>我们是在美国读书的学生，这是我们的第一次air bnb体验，感觉很棒。Grant是一个很慈祥很好相处的哈佛爷爷（这是我们偷偷给他起的"
221502,24558701,2014-12-30,24842604,Yan,"This is my first airbnb experience and it is awesome. Grant is a great host, very nice guy, we just feel a pity that the stay in Grant's home is short and don't have much time to talk to Grant. We will definitely live in Grant's again next time we go to LA."
221502,24779745,2015-01-02,25073566,Stephen,"Grant was a great host. He was quick with information and advice when we talked about my plans in Los Angeles, but never intruded and left me to myself when I wanted it. The apartment is very homey and full of books and music. The location is very convenient, especially for those traveling car-free. Would love to stay here again next time I come out to LA!"
221502,26586608,2015-02-16,23225652,Stefanie,"Grant and Bill were friendly, nice, and very helpful during my stay. I got a really big room with a comfort bed and a private bathroom. The apartment is huge with about 1000 books and tons of music. The location is very convenient, especially for those without a car. It takes about 10 min walk to the nearest metro station and there is a laundry place two blocks away. There are many good Korean restaurants and supermarkets within walking distance. I would definitely recommend this place to all travelers!"
221502,146353946,2017-04-22,19198986,Joshua,"Grant's place was wonderful. We were in LA for an extended stay for work and Wilshire Center was the perfect location for exploring the city. The room itself was very spacious and clean - the private bathroom too! The rest of the home had so much music and literature and art, it was hard not to feel inspired. We sooo recommend staying here!"
221502,183264094,2017-08-16,102559377,Haozhe,Nice furnished and peaceful scenery outside the windows. The house is near the Ralphs and Mcdonald's.
221502,188266476,2017-08-28,69301319,亮,"It is a very good place in Korean town. There are many good restaurants and markets nearby. An Avis is in a walking distance. The public transportation is also very convenient. I stayed at the second floor. There is a very clean bathroom next to my room for my private use. Downstairs is the kitchen and the living room, shared by all the renters. There are everything you need in the kitchen and it is kept clean. And as you can see from the advertised picture, there are quite a lot of books in the house, which makes me feel a pity for not staying there longer to read them well. Grant, the owner of the house and the books, is a very generous person. I like talking with him very much although my English is not good and I am not a talkative person. I think it is his charming magic that makes people feel wonderful. The other persons living there are very nice too. Although we didn't meet too much, they gave me the help they could. It made me feel at home. So it is a really wonderful experience staying at Grant's house. Hope to stay there again next time."
221502,224333383,2018-01-02,160185176,Jacob,I stayed at Grant's place with my mother and sister. It comfortably fit the three of us in the room with one bed and a sofa-bed. The location was very convenient as we were able to visit family in the Koreatown area. Definitely recommend staying here if you want to be in Koreatown.
221502,260134417,2018-05-03,8281324,Jaewoo,한인타운 중심에 있어서 접근이 편리했고 집도 너무 이쁘고 방도 다른 에어비앤비와 달리 엄청 크고 편했습니다. 강추!!

221502,343501112,2018-10-31,32888328,Allen,Grant’s place is perfect for a short or long term stay. Perfect location for getting to most places around LA. Overall a great home to visit!

Excellent location with lots of great restaurants nearby, close to the metro. I felt very much at home and would definitely stay here again."
222200,1678918,2012-07-10,2713006,John,"I am a 36 year old single male from NY who came out to Venice for a week of authentic LA living and had a blast.  The house is spacious, with a fantastic kitchen, good outdoor space and a nice master suite.  Within walking distance of a great scene on Abbott Kinney (great restaurants and bars), and very close to Marina and Santa Monica.  The neighborhood is very cool, quiet and laid back, and I would definitely come back here."
222200,16845761,2014-08-03,1344018,Ben,"I've been using AirBnB for quite some time now, but I have to say that our stay in Ramaas home was the best experience so far. Fantastic house in a great location. Highly recommended!"
222200,17701357,2014-08-16,18691688,Christy,Great neighborhood and location. House was nice.
222200,24365422,2014-12-27,15901930,Aryn,"I must admit that I take no joy in writing this review, but our disappointment was completely avoidable and unacknowledged. Our host assured us, in writing, that the house would be cleaned before our arrival. I made crystal clear that I am VERY allergic to cats and dogs and asked if that might be an issue. I was assured that cleanliness and animal hair would not be a problem."
<br/>We arrived with our entire family and baby and were absolutely astonished to discover a house that had not only NOT been cleaned,but a house that was downright dirty and unfit for guests (Especially those paying several thousand dollars for a family holiday!).,,,,
<br/>In plain site of the entire main floor,just outside the kitchen door,the deck was covered in dog poop! I'm talking about 5-6 separate helpings of dog poop! All over the place. Some of it old and hard as if it had been there quite a long time!,,,
<br/>The interior floors were covered in dirt,dust and dog hair-- everywhere,you couldn't miss it if you tried. Dog food dishes on the floor with dog food kernels all over the place and bowl of dog water coated in wet dog hair! In the small TV room,we rolled the couch trundle back to free up space and BAM! months,if not years of dirt,dog hair and random lost objects fully coated the floor.
<br/>At this stage,it reveled itself to be such an unbelievable situation that we started taking pictures of the various offenses as evidence.,,,,
<br/>The refrigerator was absolutely packed with random old food,dying produce,several cartons of opened milk and the shelves were coated in gunk. It was gross. We resigned ourselves to two shelves and scrubbed them down for our stay,avoiding the rest.,,
<br/>Upstairs the shower floor and walls were coated in that icky layer of gunk,complete with hairball in the corner. NOTHING HAD BEEN CLEANED,ANYWHERE. It was totally out of control. There simply could not have been less effort on display.,,,
<br/>We'd booked the place two months prior and had ongoing dialogue with the owners throughout,yet we literally had to spend the first hour of our vacation  cleaning,scrubbing,sweeping and scooping up poop in someone else's home.,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>It set a truly disrespectful and unsettling tone for our stay. I say this as a seasoned traveller,knowing full well that staying in someone else's space brings with it variety of other elements and tastes. This was not that. This was gross.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Otherwise,the house itself is lovely. The photos do it justice. The neighborhood and everything else were as advertised.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>But putting paying guests in that position was wholly unnecessary and unpleasant. To add insult to irony,we were charged a $300 cleaning fee.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>Customarily,"we cleaned up after ourselves before leaving.\"",,,,
222200,33422103,2015-05-27,1158157,Cameron,"We absolutely LOVE this home. It is beautiful, clean and very comfortable. We were greeted by the house manager who waited for us to come in at a late house. Ramaa had left a gift basket for us which included thoughtful essentials for my children and my wife and I."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>The neighborhood was gorgeous. Close to Abbot Kinney,parallel to the walk streets and about 15 minute walk to the beach. We were glad we didn't stay on the beach as it was very frenetic down on the boardwalk. Ramaa's house was a wonderful sanctuary from our busy days.  3 story house with plenty of room.,,,,
<br/>,,,,,
"<br/>Great house. Clean. Comfortable. Great location.\"",,,,,
222200,33488005,2015-05-28,34325623,Marilyn,"We loved staying in this beautiful home! We arrived from out of town with our family.  Ramaa went out of her way to ask us if we had any special requests or needs before our arrival. There was even a gift basket waiting for us!  The house was in perfect condition and very clean. The kitchen is very well appointed with a beautiful oven and Le Creuset cookware!  The beds are extremely comfortable and we all slept so well. The house is a beautiful Cape Cod/Martha Stewart type design with plenty of room. We comfortably fit our whole family of five and had plenty of room. Though there was no yard, we enjoyed eating on the back patio and sitting up on the roof deck.  We could have slept 2 to 3 more people. We walked everyday to Abbot Kinney and the beach. The airport is only 15 minutes away. This charming home is now our favorite place to stay in Venice. We look forward to coming back again soon. Can't say enough about how wonderful this home is!"
222200,33639701,2015-05-30,34312060,Hope,"Amazing home! The house was clean and organized with lots of ammenities from a gift basket, to bathroom items, to a gourmet  kitchen."

222200,35709289,2015-06-21,11710742,Stella,The house was in a great location and friendly neighbourhood. Really enjoyed the stay here- the house was lovely. Ramaa had left a gift basket which was a very nice gesture. Overall a fantastic time in LA and look forward to returning.
222200,38859689,2015-07-19,1571088,Ben,"We loved our time at Ramaa's house and she and her family were exceptional hosts.  The house is the perfect home to enjoy Venice from and we fell in love with the neighborhood.  It is spacious and well-kept, with plenty of room for us and our kids. We were welcomed with a gift basket full of thoughtful necessities and Ramaa was quick to respond to any questions.   Throughout our stay we felt grateful and lucky to have ended up in this home with such sincere and accommodating hosts.  Highly recommend!"
222200,40702044,2015-08-01,10023626,Chelsea,"What a wonderful home!! Ramaa was a thoughtful host who responded quickly to any special requests for my needy group. The house is very inviting and comfortable with an AMAZINGLY kitchen (Viking Stove, SubZero fridge...

It's spacious and comfortable, nicely furnished, has an amazing kitchen, and is in a perfect Venice location just a few minutes walk from Abbot Kinney. Ramaa was a great host, always easy to reach, and even left us a nice welcome gift basket filled with treats. Hope to return soon."
222200,84124444,2016-07-05,22197278,Ayaka,"I reserved Ramaa's place for my guests from Japan (5 guests), exhibiting at convention in downtown LA for 7 days."
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>They very much enjoyed the place - spacious,cute,close to nightlife and beach,and well equipped Wifi and all the living needs.,,
<br/>,,,,,
<br/>We happened to be at this beautiful place with a roof top on July 4th,and we were able to see 360 degree fireworks all over LA :) It was a great bonus!,,,,

222200,87088239,2016-07-18,32379753,Kelsey,"Beautiful BIG home in a great location. Cozy, quiet neighborhood. Family friendly. Complete with a mini table and chairs little ones love. The Master Bath is a dream shower. Any question we had was promptly answered by the sweet caretaker who has her own separate house on the property. Walking distance to Abbot & Kinney and it's a good but doable walk to Venice Beach. Also the personal driveway is a huge help when parking a car. I highly recommend this beautiful home.<br/>"
222200,88891618,2016-07-25,6154146,Shelley,Pictures don't do justice to this home.   It's even more beautiful in person.  The kitchen was clean and spacious.  She was easy to reach.
222200,95395652,2016-08-19,28546980,Roar,House was fantastic! Clean and well equipped. Spacious for our family of eight. Kids loved the loft. Great and walkable neighborhood. Short stroll to Abbot Kinney and beach. Would definitely come back!

222200,124645493,2017-01-02,6138787,Esther,"Ramaa was an exemplary host. She was accessible, responsive to questions and very hospitable. Her home is a rare jewel in Venice -it has all the space of a rambling Cape Cod house, with a fantastic kitchen, and all the conveniences of Venice - ie, walking distance to Abbott Kinney and beach, and very close to Whole Foods, and Santa Monica, not to mention LAX. The back deck is glorious and inviting, and there's a bonus deck on the 3rd floor. The best place we've ever stayed in Venice. Thank you, Ramaa."
222200,161376543,2017-06-17,6375714,Rich,"This was truly one of the nicest places we have ever rented! Loved the neighborhood, the house had amazing vibes, was modern and very comfortable. We did not want to leave! I would recommend this to everyone I know planning a trip to LA. Thank you"
222200,174691273,2017-07-26,6454772,Roy,"Ramaa's home near Abbot Kinney Blvd is perfect for a family base in Santa Monica/LA. We are a family of 7 and we're very comfortable for 7 nights. <br/>The best things about this house are its location, charm and host. It's clearly a family home that's lived in and loved with games, books and lively artwork everywhere. If you're after a sanitised, featureless minimalist house - this isn't for you. If you like homely charm, a family atmosphere with everything you need to relax and enjoy yourself this is perfect!<br/>It's a very safe and quiet neighbourhood just minutes walk from Abbot Kinney with all its fabulous shops, coffee houses, restaurants, and bars.  Venice beach is just 10 more minutes walk.  <br/>Santa Monica's Maine Street is only 20-25 minutes walk or 10 minutes drive. <br/>Whilst from outside the property looks small inside it is very spacious. It has 3 good size bedrooms on first floor with 2 bathrooms. And a really big bedroom on the roof with its own roof deck. The kitchen is really well equipped. There is also a small TV snug room with Netflix and Apple TV which the kids loved. <br/>We had the need to contact Ramaa, our host, just twice and both times she was super efficient.  <br/>Overall we had a great stay and would love to return. Well done Ramaa!<br/>"

Loved the tasteful design throughout and is perfect for couples visiting LA. <br/>Hosts were friendly and welcoming and couldn’t have asked for a better experience. Highly recommend!"
67089,640638290,2020-07-20,98289027,Jan,We had a wonderful stay with Brenna - the listing is beautiful and in a great location. Brenna was very welcoming and would not hesitate booking her home again.
67089,640867426,2020-07-21,81993113,Alp,We only stayed here for a night and it had everything we needed. Great communications and ease of check-in as well. Did not stay long enough to write a more comprehensive review but overall satisfied with our stay.
67089,641897477,2020-07-24,75466293,Meme,"Brenna and Charlie’s place was absolutely wonderful. We arrived around 6 and kept good communication skills between each other. They offer a parking permit which is a huge plus and you can park right outside their home! We didn’t get to enjoy all the beautiful amenities that they offered since our visit was a very quick one, and we weren’t in the home for too long but they have created a lovely atmosphere for guests. I would definitely stay here again. 5/5 stars!"
67089,642351801,2020-07-25,66656250,Scott,Had an awesome time. Loved the backyard setup.

We ate dinner outside by the fire pit every night, laid in the hammock multiple times each day, and enjoyed the lovely hot tub. The backyard was stunning and the hospitality was excellent."
67089,646396744,2020-08-03,228600302,Tess,"Stayed here for one of our honeymoon nights and it was so wonderful! I especially loved how beautifully clean the place was, the bed was very comfortable, and we had pretty much everything we needed. Only thing I would mention is that the ac was difficult to figure out/maybe didnt work? (but there was a fan that worked just fine) and that the hot water was a little low, but overall it didnt alter our experience much and we had an amazing time ! would totally stay here again :)"
9140,21777948,2014-10-24,10553729,Kelly,"The neighborhood is totally cool! Great location right near a shopping center and not far from the convention center, restaurants, and the water. Wendell is great, he will let you borrow bikes, use the parking garage, and there are plenty of essentials like shampoo, water, etc. Very convenient, and you have your own private entrance to the guest area."
9140,21950754,2014-10-27,20942935,Miriam,"This was my first time using Airbnb and I could not have had a better experience. My stay with Wendell & team was WONDERFUL. The room was comfortable, clean, and spacious. Wendell went above and beyond to ensure we were comfortable. He is a very gracious host; he allowed us to use his kitchen to eat our meals and he provided a mini refrigerator in the kitchen to store our food! The living space has a warm comfortable ambiance. We even had the opportunity to speak with him and get to know each other a bit! The room and experience truly exceeded our expectations! I was overall very pleased with my first-time experience using Airbnb thanks to Wendell & team :-) I definitely 100% recommend staying here!!!"

67089,651661370,2020-08-15,165444535,Maria,Quiet and comfortable.  Hung out on hammock in back yard.  Hosts got back to us right away when we had questions about where to find grocery store etc.  Provided a parking pass for street parking which was a breeze.
67089,652371792,2020-08-16,190194849,Macy,It was a nice place and calm stay. Bed was very comfortable and Brenna replied quickly for the most part. Towels smelled really clean and I enjoyed our stay.

67089,662217543,2020-09-08,33920118,Dennis (Bo),Great place. Very clean and friendly hosts. We were beginning our cross country move from LA to NC and were allowed extra time to pack. The back house is spacious and really cool in how it’s set up. Could very comfortably sleep a couple and could easily sleep a family of 4. Brenna has great style and really put a nice touch on the place. The area of the house is very close to everything on the Westside and safe enough to park your car away from the high traffic areas.
67089,663355161,2020-09-12,38506876,Kayla,Brenna and Charlie were delightful hosts. Their bungalow had everything we needed and more. We enjoyed the patio fire pit and hot tub most of all. The home was thoughtfully designed and very comfortable. The location was ideal and communication was the best I’ve ever with an Airbnb host. We enjoyed sharing a few  friendly conversations and getting to know their beautiful family as well as being given plenty of privacy.
67089,664462449,2020-09-14,93316032,Sudev,"Hubs & I loved our stay! The place is as clean and cute as you'd imagine (and see in pictures), there's so much character and love in the details (perfect place if you're in need of some Zen), but what really makes this bnb special (and one of the best we've been to) are the HOSTS. They're the sweetest family that accommodated all our wishes and treated us like friends. Really hoping we can come back sometime"
67089,667132782,2020-09-22,106375973,Yusuf,Brenna was a great host and the guesthouse was beautiful. She was very accommodating considering the short notice we gave. The location was great
67089,668186591,2020-09-26,53108183,Jesse,Such a great place to retreat to. So close to everything but off the path enough to not feel overwhelmed. Would stay there every time I travel alone or with another.
67089,668847073,2020-09-27,231704153,David,The place was so cute! Enjoyed our stay and the surroundings of the location!
67089,669958423,2020-10-01,272355062,Brian,This was our second time staying at this guest house. The place was perfect so we knew when we were coming back to Culver City that we wanted to stay here. Would highly recommend to anyone looking to stay in the area.
67089,670575957,2020-10-03,233678520,Theresa,"This place was extremely close to everything! The beach is 15 mins away, while incredible coffee shops and food were literally around the corner from the home. Finding the home, and checking in were simple. The back house is spacious, equipped with everything including an amazing full kitchen. The shared backyard was peaceful and relaxing, however my partner and I anticipated more privacy but understandably the front house wanted their window shades open for sunlight (which meant ours stayed closed or you could see each other’s every move). We did get some complete privacy and we enjoyed breakfast outside and at night time we hopped into their amazing hot tub! We cannot complain about a thing because we have a comfortable and pleasant stay! This is certainly a place you want to stay if you’re looking for a relaxing and home feel stay! Thank you Brenna for allowing us to stay in your home."
67089,700248511,2020-10-13,77602655,Patricia,"I chose this place because the photos caught my attention and it was very central to what I had planned for my boyfriends surprise birthday. When we arrived, I was surprised to find the place looked exactly like in the photos. It is a very cute and modern location with everything we needed to enjoy our stay. I highly recommend this place and Brenna was a wonderful host. If we ever find ourselves needing a place in LA again, I will definitely book here!"
67089,700692075,2020-10-15,4689537,Rachel,"This was a staycation for my husband and I to take a night away from the kids. It was so relaxing and wonderful! The space itself is beautiful and laid out really well. The hot tub was super relaxing. It's quiet and set back so you don't even know you're in LA, a huge city. Would definitely recommend!"
222200,183260736,2017-08-16,132243215,Kemp,Very nice for family's.    Host was quick to respond on any questions.
222200,220107691,2017-12-20,18174151,Ann,"Ramaa and Cameron were wonderful hosts, quickly available to answer questions or help.  The house is beautiful and had everything we needed.  If we return to Venice we'll definitely stay there again."
222200,223117917,2017-12-31,158102059,Gordon,"Ramaa's home is in an excellent location, very close to the shops and restaurants of Abbott Kinney. The bedrooms are all large. The kitchen is bright and very well equipped . Both the rooftop deck and the backyard deck are private and really enjoyable. We were able to get early checkin and Ramaa was easily contacted if we had any questions. I can highly recommend Ramaa's accommodation."
222200,431392531,2019-03-31,37442264,Todd,Ramaa and Cameron are wonderful hosts. They are super responsive and their home is gorgeous. The master bathroom is an oasis. The art is wonderful. And the location is excellent. Can’t wait to come back.
222200,438442929,2019-04-16,3860488,Felix,"Our stay was great! We were out of the house most of the time on a film shoot, but it was really lovely when we were there. The roof deck is a particularly wonderful amenity. It was so nice to go up there and enjoy sunrise and sunset."
222200,441345326,2019-04-21,55167368,Claudia,"Cameron and Ramaa's house is beautiful, cozy and functional. They offer a real- at- home experience out of your country. Cafeterias and interesting places are nearby. Neighborhood is really quiet and safe."
222200,467680780,2019-06-10,31930273,Jaana,This was such a nice house! We were a group of 6 people on a work trip and there was plenty of room for all of us. Loved the all white linens! <br/>The view from the rooftop is beautiful and we got to see the sunset on our last night there. The backyard is also a nice spot to relax and has a water fountain! Location for the house is just few blocks from both Lincoln and Abbot Kinney boulevards. They both had great vegan and vegetarian restaurants. <br/>Cameron and Ramaa were great hosts and responded very quickly on any emails and/or texts. We would love to stay there again. Thank you again!
222200,486486851,2019-07-12,2186867,Richard,What an amazing experience my family and I had. The house was absolutely perfect and the hosts were so communicative and accommodating. We couldn’t have asked for more. We’ll definitely be coming back!
222200,488949304,2019-07-15,226372181,Karin,"We got a very warm welcome by Cameron. He took time to show us the whole house and gave us some advices where to go. The house is perfectly situated, close to shops and restaurants, in a wonderful and totally quiet neighborhood. It is a very clean and bright house with a charming garden and fully equipped kitchen, bathes etc. We can highly recommend the house as the best place to discover Venice Beach."
222200,495274887,2019-07-25,595920,Hamish,Wonderful house in a fabulous location to take advantage of Venice and its beaches! The house is spacious and well set up with everything that one could wish for including an especially great kitchen. Very generous and communicative hosts!
222200,497704148,2019-07-28,3967422,Thomas,"Well worth the cost. The best thing about this listing are the hosts. They are friendly, responsive, and very accommodating. This is a lovely home with awesome amenities. Nothing to complain about in the least."
222200,501512979,2019-08-03,5977582,Jennifer,"Beautiful, large character home in Venice, walking distance to Abbot Kinney, the beach, restaurants, bars, shopping, i.e. everything Venice has to offer. I took my kids and my parents for a one week staycation and it was just perfect. Will definitely return again!"
222200,507598620,2019-08-11,139096837,Yolanda,"This place is fantastic!  Close to Abbot Kinney (walkable), a short drive to the beach, and is a great house.  Lots of space.  Also, Cameron and Ramaa were very communicative throughout our stay, so any tiny issues we had were resolved quickly."
222200,537475712,2019-09-28,14418247,Brendan,"This place is OUTSTANDING! Cam and Ramaa are some of the most helpful hosts we've encountered on Air BnB. They live next door, were flexible and responded quickly. The place is sparkling clean, modern yet cozy with a ton of small details that make it feel like a home. <br/>I was traveling with a team of 10 and everyone had privacy and a comfortable place to sleep! I highly recommend also renting the cute guest house in the back even if you don't have a large group, it's a great place to hang out and has it's own amenities.  The neighborhood is quaint and a great and safe place for a morning jog. I could go on and on, we will definitely stay here again. Thanks Cam and Ramaa!"
9140,22532194,2014-11-09,8441109,Miriam,"Wendell was the quintessential AirB&B host. He met me at the garage, directed me in parking my car, and walked me up to the apartment/room. He gave me a tour of the apartment/room and bathroom as well as the rest of the condo. It's a lovely space. Also Wendell added some special touches - provided some food basics, restaurant and store recommendations - and just plain great conversation. He also is very simply a very kind and interesting man. I hope we keep in touch.  Finally, the condo is very conveniently located. It was easy to walk down to Ocean Blvd and participate in my conference for a fraction of the cost of the conference hotel. Long Beach has some great restaurants, too. Great stay all in all."
9140,22755202,2014-11-13,18474112,Robert,The place was great. Really enjoyed my stay.
222200,547297013,2019-10-14,42262651,Robert J,A very special home in a great location with the best of hosts. Our family enjoyed a delightful stay. Highly recommend !!!!!
222200,572482503,2019-12-02,9128001,Neha,"We had such a great Thanksgiving at Cameron + Ramaa’s! The house was perfect for our family — clean, spacious, and stocked with everything we needed. The location was incredible and very close to a lot of Venice hot spots.  And Cameron + Ramaa were so incredibly warm and helpful in their communication.<br/>All in all, we really felt at home and highly recommend this house for a Venice trip!"
222200,584199613,2019-12-29,32789661,Mary Ann,The house was perfect for us.   The location was great.  Cameron was an awesome host.  He was very responsive and accommodating.  We hope to return next year.  Thank you.
222200,608481025,2020-02-20,92291892,Luis,"Great stay at cameron’s place. Great location, nice street, super clean and cozy!"
222200,640279841,2020-07-19,17346890,Sep,"Beautiful place, great vibes, lovely location. Thanks again !"
222200,649885637,2020-08-11,99553381,Max,"Cameron and Ramaa were incredibly communicative and thoughtful hosts, and they have clearly put a lot of love and care into their home. They allowed us early check in which made a huge difference since we had to get our 2 year old acclimated to the new house. Check in was a breeze. Overall the house is really lovely and full of character and lots of interesting art. We were a group of four adults and one toddler so there were plenty of bedrooms available, though only the master has an en suite. The 2 queen beds in secondary bedrooms are all against walls to where you have to climb over someone to get out of bed in the middle of the night. Tough for couples (and my aging parents). One major thing to note is that the second largest bedroom is on the third floor and only accessible via an outside metal spiral staircase that was a bit treacherous to climb and descend. We had planned on sleeping in that room since the other secondary bedrooms are small, but it wasn’t feasible since it required going outside and down the staircase in the middle of the night to pee. This needs to be called out clearly in the listing since it is marketed as 5 bedrooms. (Though likely wouldn’t matter at all to a big group of 20-something’s) The kitchen and dining room were perfect and spacious, and our son loved playing in the little backyard with the fountain. The appliances were all top notch but if you plan on cooking the pans and skillets are all extremely scratched or chipped and very difficult to use. We primarily ordered takeout from all the great restaurants in the area and had a great time in the dining room eating and listening to Taylor Swift records on the cute little phonograph. The living room is perfect and very well decorated, and the master bath was lovely as well. The only place to really watch TV is in the small den room downstairs, and the four of us had to really crowd on to the pullout couch to watch in the evenings. That said the location is so great we spent most of our time exploring the adjacent walking streets, on the beach, or strolling on Abbot Kinney. Plentiful street parking on the street and very quiet with friendly neighbors. As other reviews noted the sheets were quite soft and there’s a neverending supply of towels which we appreciated since we hit the beach most days. Overall it is a very lovely home but I think inaccurate to market as a luxury property - since the owners also live there they do have a lot of stuff that makes it feel more like staying in an (albeit lovely) friends home than in a luxury rental. But the price was very reasonable and we had a great escape from pandemic life that we’ll remember fondly."
222200,652447722,2020-08-16,1459186,Pejman,We loved the home and the location! Cameron and RD made us feel at home.
222200,661873046,2020-09-07,5693804,Vicky,Amazing location and very eclectic home! Cameron and Ramaa were great communicators and made check in and check out very easy. The home was perfect for our large family beach getaway and we especially loved the balcony patio and the backyard space. The kitchen was also fantastic for cooking and serving a large crowd!
222200,664437182,2020-09-14,1534149,Erin,"This house is not only beautiful and comfortable, but the owners are truly good people. We had to evacuate due to the fires above Pasadena, and they were ready for us instantly. We have been very careful not to go out much since quarantine started, so although it was for scary reasons, the house was so beautiful and comfortable we couldn’t help but feel a little like we were on vacation. We both had to work from the house all weekend, and it had enough separate areas for us to be able to focus on work uninterrupted. It was as seamless as it could have been in such a crazy situation. There is a cafe right around the corner that we got food and coffee from every day. It was only a few blocks away. Just perfect."
222200,664926193,2020-09-16,3607382,Daniela,"You’ll wish you lived here.  Cam and RD are exceptional hosts. This is a beautiful Plus home and we felt truly lucky to stay here! We needed a place to stay at the last minute. They accommodated our unique needs (late check in) and we were extremely comfortable (comfy beds, all the amenities).  The house is so incredibly located so I would walk to the beach, to Abbott Kinney or Rose Ave to have a bite, super safe and quiet. There is also a parking spot was great. Highly recommend!"
222200,665457702,2020-09-18,27954321,Richelle,"Great house in great location. Booking a Plus house is definitely worth the price. Honestly, Cam and RD were the best hosts I've ever interacted with. Very responsible and super helpful. Had a great stay."
222200,666467866,2020-09-20,35015555,Naomi,"Super hosts! Super house! Beautifully decorated and the bedding was extremely high quality. The house is very clean. Located in a perfect location. We walked to the beach and to dinner, then came back and sat on the top deck drinking wine. Best long weekend! Thank you Cam + Rd."
222200,701882635,2020-10-18,3053014,Craig,Wonderful home. Highly recommend!

67089,705958788,2020-11-01,5742196,Ashley,We loved staying at brennas place! So well designed and comfortable. A great family to share an outdoor space with during our 2 week stay. The place was clean and well taken care of. We’d definitely stay here again!
67089,744676969,2021-04-02,10233712,Carlin,Great place. We loved the outdoor space with wonderful faerie lights for eating outside. Helpful pamphlet with notes about the house and nearby eateries.  Great communication before and during our stay. We appreciated the call back to figure out the direct tv remote. The lever at the top of the remote had to be on the right setting to be able  to change the channels.
67089,745580286,2021-04-04,31557038,May,"I loved staying here!! Everything was so beautiful! I had trouble figuring out the gate latch at first (we got in late, would have been easier to figure out in daylight). <br/>We loved all of the open space to cook meals and the tv in the bedroom. Thank you for thinking of everything!"
67089,747151520,2021-04-09,36354783,George,We loved our stay in this air bnb. The shared outdoor space was great - we really enjoyed the hot tub and fire pit. Great WiFi for remote working. Very tranquil yard and the house was decorated nicely. Will definitely return.
67089,748948150,2021-04-15,37724725,Karen,"Brenna’s place was cozy and beautiful, and she made check- in a breeze. We enjoyed the hot tub and fire pit during our stay. Even though Brenna was away for the week, she made sure we were cared for and she was super responsive to our messages."
67089,750640777,2021-04-20,27399238,Grisha,"We really enjoyed our stay at Brenna’s apartment. The bungalow is really awesome, especially we loved to chill in the courtyard. Definitely will come back once again :)"
67089,751582621,2021-04-24,94102543,Martina,This was a perfect spot to relax and enjoy the city. The place has a warm charm to it and Brenna was easy to communicate with and made the whole process a breeze.
67089,752464383,2021-04-26,103368632,Sunkist,"It was our first Airbnb Plus reservation, and we were pretty impressed with Brenna's hospitality. Her place was exquisite and stylish, and it had all the essential amenities. We were delighted with the backyard and patio area. The hammock and hot tub were perfect for relaxing after a long day. It's in reasonable proximity to LAX, Downtown LA, Venice Beach, and Santa Monica. We highly recommend this stay."
67089,755641215,2021-05-06,58516238,Jihyeon,"Brenna’s place was great! We spent two nights, and her place was almost the middle of everything. Most of popular travel points were max 20 minutes away. Parking spaces were plenty. Her family and a dog, Maple was friendly and gentle.<br/>However, because her place has a great garden, there were spiders and their naps in the room. But it wasn’t a big deal to us!"
67089,756832650,2021-05-09,26971653,Lisa,"My sister and I rented Brenna and Charlie's beautiful place for three nights and we LOVED LOVED LOVED it!  Everything was perfect and the hot tub was fabulous.  We would definitely rent their home again.  It really is a tranquil oasis and after a long day out, it was a great place to come back to and chill out.  We really enjoyed hanging out and talking with them -- they are both very friendly and had great recommendations.  We miss their sweet pooch, the fabulous Miss Mable!"
67089,758466243,2021-05-15,81819379,Shanna,The entire place was so tranquil and beautiful. Would definitely stay here again! Highly recommend. You won’t regret it.
67089,759918435,2021-05-18,30673295,Arash,"Brenna's place was the perfect BnB to stay in for any plans you have in LA. The neighborhood and surrounding area is great, plenty of good food and drink around, and the hot tub is the cherry on top. I'd recommend Brenna's place to anyone looking for a BnB in LA."

Their dog is friendly.  my daughter was in love with your dog. 😊😊Thanks Brenna’s for allowing us to stay at your place, we had an amazing stay. I’ll definitely stay there if I ever visit Los Angels area. Also, brenna and her husband was kinda enough to remind me about the  stress cleaning so I could move my car across the street."
67089,762383380,2021-05-24,161727887,Allyssa,Wonderfulspot! Wish we would have gotten to stay here longer than 24 hours😭 it felt very “California Vibes” and Ioved that it was a whole house! Updated nicely. Loved the outdoor plants and decor! Great snacks!
67089,762638925,2021-05-25,214023780,Rawls,"We stayed at Brenna’s place to catch an early flight out of LAX, and it couldn’t have been more perfect. Super stylish, great privacy, and great location. Highly recommend!"
